      <h2 class="uppercase">The British Ways of Life</h2>

      <p>Knowing and understanding one country’s customs and traditions allows us to have a deeper understanding as to why people live such lives, say such things or do such actions. The culture of the United Kingdom is rooted in the country’s long history, its interaction with the cultures of Europe, the traditions of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and the impact of the British&nbsp;Empire.</p>
      <p>British culture, customs and traditions vary from the weird to the wonderful, from the traditional to the popular, and from the simple to the grand. The formation of the ideas, celebrations and notions that comprise today’s quintessential British lifestyle started centuries ago, giving importance and meaning to the people’s existence. These customs and traditions stood the test of time, although not without some changes to accommodate the modernizing world. Despite the inevitable transformation in British values and norms, the roots can still be easily traced back to the earlier English&nbsp;civilization.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t1">Language</h3>
      <p>If language is transmitted as part of culture, it is no less true that culture as a whole is transmitted very largely through language. Language and culture developed together and influenced each other as they&nbsp;evolved.</p>
      <p>English has had 1,400 years of development from its West Germanic roots to its current form. This language has drawn influence from Latin and French as well as Norse. It is not only the dominant language in Britain but is also the third most-spoken language in the&nbsp;world.</p>
      <p>The English language is currently the official language of the UK with roughly 95&nbsp;% of the population speaking as monolingual. However there are a number of regional languages also spoken. An estimated 700,000 people speak Welsh in the UK, an official language in Wales and approximately 1.5 million people in the UK speak Scottish. There are over 4 million people living in the UK who do not speak English as their first or primary language. And, in fact, nearly 150,000 residents of the UK do not speak English at all. There are also many immigrant languages spoken on the British Isles, mainly within inner city areas. In England and Wales, the most widely spoken language after English is Polish. After English, Scottish, Welsh, and Polish, the next most widely spoken languages are Indian and Pakistani ones like Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, and Punjabi, which taken together account for about a million people. There are also about 141,000 Chinese speakers and other pockets of smaller&nbsp;languages.</p>
      <p>There have always been words traded between languages: for example, words like <i>croissant</i> from French, or <i>pajamas</i> from Hindi. But the high number of Polish speakers might mean that Polish has a particular influence on the&nbsp;language.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t2">Religion</h3>
      <p>Freedom of religious belief and worship is taken for granted in modern Britain. The UK is a multicultural country and home to followers of almost every religion&nbsp;imaginable.</p>
      <figure class="left">

        <figcaption>Canterbury Cathedral</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Every religion in the world is represented in the UK. While the UK is basically secular, it is also very Christian. Since St. Augustine brought Christianity to England, it has been the official religion of the land. Church-state conflicts in the Middle Ages prepared the ground for the separation from Rome under Henry&nbsp;VIII. There are two established churches: in England&nbsp;– the Anglican Church (formed by King Henry&nbsp;VIII in&nbsp;1534), in Scotland&nbsp;– the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (established by the Treaty of Union in&nbsp;1707). The Monarch is the “Supreme Governor” of the Church of England, which is divided into two provinces: Canterbury and York. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church. In England the highest number of Christians is found in north-east England. There are some more prominent Protestant traditions, such as Methodism and Baptism (which came from Holland in the 16<sup>th</sup> century). About 6 million people are Catholics in the UK. Non-Christian religions are represented by Islam (Muslims have now emerged as the second largest religion after Christianity), Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Judaism. Across the UK, growing numbers of people no longer believe in the need for church&nbsp;membership.</p>
      <p>According to the latest census, Christianity is the majority religion. Among Christians, Anglicans are the most common denomination. It has been estimated that less than 5&nbsp;% of those who might describe themselves as Anglicans regularly attend services. Many others are christened, married and buried in Anglican ceremonies but otherwise hardly ever go to church. Regular attendance for many Anglicans is traditionally as much a social as a religious&nbsp;activity.</p>
      <p>Another Christian tradition includes Roman Catholicism. After the establishment of Protestantism in Britain, Catholicism was for a time an illegal religion and then a barely tolerated religion. Not until 1850 was a British Catholic hierarchy reestablished. A large proportion of Catholics in modern Britain are those whose family roots are in Italy, Ireland or elsewhere in Europe. Around 5.2 million Catholics live in England and Wales, or around 9.6&nbsp;% of the population there and nearly 700,000 in Scotland, or around&nbsp;14&nbsp;%.</p>
      <p>The Puritan tradition in Britain is connected with the Presbyterian Church. In Scotland it became the nation’s established church known simply as ‘the kirk’ (the Scots word for ‘church’). There are also many Presbyterians in England and Northern Ireland. After Presbyterians, the largest traditional nonconformist group in Britain is the Methodist&nbsp;Society.</p>
      <p>Britain is, however, becoming less and less of a Christian country with the numbers of people who consistently attend church service on Sunday diminishing with time. Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam have large followership in the UK. The UK hosts the largest population of Indians outside India and also has the fifth-largest community of Jews in the world. British Jews number about 300,000 today. The vast majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom live in England (5.02&nbsp;% of the population). London has the greatest population of Muslims in the&nbsp;country.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t3">The British and Traditions</h3>
      <p>Societies change over time while their reputations lag behind. Many things which are often regarded as typically British derive from books, songs or plays which were written a long time ago and which are no longer representative of modern life. One example of this is the popular belief that Britain is a ‘land of tradition’. This is what most tourist brochures claim which is based on what can be seen in public life and on centuries of political continuity. And at this level it is undoubtedly&nbsp;true.</p>
      <p>The British attach great importance to tradition. Many of them still feel strongly about the monarchy because it adds a great deal of colour to their life. They like court ceremonies, jubilees and parades. A great place to breathe in the British culture and tradition is&nbsp;London.</p>

        <figcaption>The Imperial State Crown</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The annual ceremony of <i>the State Opening of Parliament</i> carefully follows customs which are centuries old. It is an event which formally marks the beginning of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It includes a speech from the throne known as the King’s Speech. It takes place in the House of Lords chamber, traditionally in November, in front of both Houses of Parliament. The monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, reads a speech that has been prepared by his government outlining its plans for that parliamentary&nbsp;year.</p>

        <img src="../img/10-3.jpg" alt="Trooping the Colour">
        <figcaption>Trooping the Colour</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The military ceremony of <i>Trooping the Colour</i> has been a tradition since the 17<sup>th</sup> century when various regiments showed off their flags, so that all the troops would recognize their banners during the battle. In&nbsp;1748 King George II combined the annual summer military march with his birthday celebration even though he was born in October. Ever since, the reigning monarch has had the option of having an official birthday publicly with a parade on the second Saturday in June. The Sovereign travels down the Mall from Buckingham Palace in a royal procession with an escort of Household Cavalry. After receiving a royal salute, he inspects his troops in the ceremonial uniform of red tunics and bearskin hats. A key part of the Trooping the Colour tradition is the appearance of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the fly-past of the Royal Air Force (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_s5Q8b53qU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Highlights from The Queen’s Official Birthday. Trooping the Colour&nbsp;2021</a>).</p>
      <p><i>The Changing of the Guard</i> ceremony at Buckingham Palace is both a colourful military tradition and an important reminder of the close relationship between the Armed Forces and their King. Household Troops have guarded the Sovereign and the Royal Palaces since 1660. When Queen Victoria moved into Buckingham Palace in&nbsp;1837, the Queen’s Guard remained at St James’s Palace, with a detachment guarding Buckingham Palace, as it still does today. Today, the main ceremony is conducted at Buckingham Palace. The strength of the Guard is governed by the King’s presence. If the Royal Standard is flying above the Palace, the King is in residence and the number of sentries is increased. The Changing of the Guard ceremony marks the moment when the soldiers currently on duty, the Old Guard, exchange places with the New Guard (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0DHVxPSmzc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Changing of the Guard Resumes for First&nbsp;Time</a>).</p>
      <p>A great tourist attraction is also the ritual <i>Ceremony of the Keys</i> which is held every night at the Tower of London. The chief warder closes all the gates and after exchanging the passwords with a sentry hands him the keys of the Tower. The sentry, in turn, passes the keys to the Resident Governor for safe-keeping. The warders, known as ‘beefeaters’, wear scarlet Tudor costumes, which emphasizes the unique atmosphere of the place (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2YlEZ0zSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ceremony of the Keys at Tower of&nbsp;London</a>).</p>
      <p>Although the British may not be willing to admit it, they love tradition. One of the British Christmas traditions is the <i>King’s Speech on Christmas Day</i> around 3 pm. when the King sends his festive wishes and message to the public from the comfort of his own British palace or castle. Christmas broadcast started in&nbsp;1932, when King George V delivered the first King’s speech written for him by poet and writer <a href="7.1.html#kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. Over 20 million people listened to it and there was widespread approval not only of Kipling’s words, but also of the king’s delivery of them. George V made an annual Christmas broadcast for the rest of his reign, the last coming less than a month before his death in&nbsp;1936. But there would be no Christmas speech from his son Edward VIII that year. When he did make a broadcast in December, it was to announce his abdication. It would take the wartime Christmas messages of George VI to turn the royal Christmas broadcast into the tradition it is&nbsp;today.</p>
      <img class="left" src="../img/10-4.jpg" alt="Merry Christmas">
      <p><i>Sending and receiving greeting cards</i> is an established tradition in the UK, being an important part of British culture. The first Christmas cards appeared in Britain in&nbsp;1843, their creator being an English artist <a href="7.1.html#horsley">John Calcott Horsley</a>. <a href="7.1.html#cole">Sir Henry Cole</a> asked the artist to design a card that he could send to each of his friends instead of writing all his letters. Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales in the UK, with over 600 million cards sold annually. The robin is a common sight in gardens throughout the UK and it began featuring on many Christmas cards in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Sending Valentine’s Day cards became hugely popular in Britain in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, a practice which has since spread to other nations. Other popular occasions for sending greeting cards in the UK are birthdays, Mother’s Day, Easter and Father’s&nbsp;Day.</p>

        <img src="../img/10-5.jpg" alt="The heritage of Hogmanay">
        <figcaption>The heritage of Hogmanay</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The British calendar is full of many events which add merriment to British life. Customs vary throughout the British Isles. <i>Hogmanay </i>is the Scottish word for the last day of the year and is synonymous with the celebration of the New Year in the Scottish manner which involves the practice of first-footing starting immediately after midnight. The first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and to give a symbolic gift such as salt (less common today), coal, shortbread, whisky, and black bun (a rich fruit cake) brings different kinds of luck to the householder for the rest of the year. Food and drink are then offered to the guests. Traditionally, tall, dark-haired men are preferred as the&nbsp;first-foot.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t4" style="clear: both;">National Character</h3>
      <p>The British, like the people of every country, tend to be attributed with certain characteristics which are supposedly&nbsp;typical.</p>
      <p>Englishmen tend to be rather conservative, they love familiar things. They are hostile or at least bored, when they hear any suggestion that some modification of their habits or the introduction of something new and unknown into their lives might be to their advantage. This conservatism, on a national scale, may be illustrated by reference to the public attitude to the&nbsp;monarchy.</p>
      <p>The British value continuity over modernity for its own sake. They do not consider it especially smart to live in a new house and, in fact, there is prestige in living in an obviously old one. They have a general sentimental attachment to older, supposedly safer, times. Their Christmas cards usually depict scenes from past centuries; they like their pubs to look old; they were reluctant to change their system of&nbsp;currency.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/10-6.jpg" alt="A traditional open fire in a British home">
        <figcaption>A traditional open fire in a British home</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Most English people remain strongly attached to the open coal fire (when heating houses), although it causes much work and adds to the pollution of the air, and sometimes pours smoke into the room which it is heating because they think that a living-room without a fireplace will be a room without the basic characteristic of&nbsp;cosiness.</p>
      <p>The British are rather proud of being different. It is, for example, very difficult to imagine that they will ever agree to change from driving on the left-hand side of the road to driving on the right. Why should they change just to be like everyone else? Indeed, as far as they are concerned, not being like everyone else is a good reason not to&nbsp;change.</p>
      <p>The British government has been trying for years and years to promote the metric system and to get British people to use the same scales that are used nearly everywhere else in the world. But it has had only limited success. British manufactures are obliged to give the weight of their tins and packets in kilos and grams but everybody in Britain still shops in pounds and ounces. The weather forecasters of the television use the Celsius scale of temperature. But nearly everybody still thinks in Fahrenheit. British people continue to measure distances, amounts of liquid and themselves using scales of measurement that are not used anywhere else in Europe. Even the use of the 24-hour clock is comparatively&nbsp;restricted.</p>
      <p>It is probably true that the British, especially the English, are more reserved than the people of many other countries. They find it comparatively difficult to indicate friendship by open display of affection. Indeed, they are not very open or spontaneous. They do not kiss or embrace when greeting so as not to allow familiarity. They are even accused of being hypocritical because they might think one thing and say another. It is not easy to make friends with them but once you have made a friend, it is a friend for&nbsp;life.</p>
      <p>It is true that the British care for the needy. Tens of thousands of volunteers are actively involved in charity work. As well as giving direct help to those in need they raise money by organizing sales, marathons, standing in the street, etc. This voluntary activity has often been so effective that whole countrywide networks have been set up without any government help at all. It is no accident that many of the world’s largest and most well-known charities (Amnesty International and the Save the Children Fund) began in&nbsp;Britain.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/10-7.jpg" alt="A thatched cottage in Hampshire">
        <figcaption>A thatched cottage in Hampshire</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Historically, English daily life and customs were markedly different in urban and rural areas. Indeed, much of English literature and popular culture has explored the tension between town and country and between farm and factory. Today, even though the British are among the world’s most cosmopolitan ties to the rural past remain strong. One of the most striking aspects of the national character is the love of the countryside. Although most of the British live in towns and cities but they have an idealized vision of the countryside. To them, the countryside means peace and quiet, beauty, good health and no crime. The countryside represents stability. Most of them would live in a country village. Ideally, this village would consist of thatched cottages built around an area of grass. Nearby, there would be a pond with ducks on it. Even if they cannot get into the countryside, many British people still spend a lot of their time with ‘nature’. They love gardens, their own above all and this is probably one reason why so many people prefer to live in houses rather than&nbsp;flats.</p>
      <p>The British tend to have a sentimental attitude to animals. Nearly half of the households in Britain keep at least one domestic pet. Animals are not only loved but protected by law. The status of pets is taken seriously. If anyone, for example, leaves a cat to starve in an empty house while the owner goes for his holiday, he can be sent to prison. But the love of animals goes beyond sentimental attachment to domestic pets. Wildlife programmes are by far the most popular kind of television documentary. Millions of families have ‘bird-tables’ in their gardens. There is even a special hospital (St Tiggywinkles) which treats injured wild animals. Thousands of people are enthusiastic bird-watchers. This peculiarly British pastime often involves spending hours lying in wet and cold undergrowth, trying to get a glimpse of some rare&nbsp;species.</p>
      <p>But some people doubt whether there is anything that can be called a British national character as the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish have retained their separate identities despite English&nbsp;domination.</p>
      <p>The Scots have developed strong national characteristics which separate them from the other nations inhabiting the UK. Carefulness, indifference, dourness, pawkiness, implacability, splendid courage are characteristics to be found in part or in whole in every member of the people who honour Bruce and worship Burns. It cannot be denied that many of the Scottish people are not as friendly and pleasant in their manners as could be desired, and yet that is only a surface matter, which may perhaps be accounted for by the historical fact that in distant times, when the country was almost continually at war with England, a cautious reserve had to be adopted as a mode of personal&nbsp;protection.</p>
      <p>The Scottish character exhibits a considerable share of both energy and perseverance. It may safely be said that a country with so many physical disadvantages could never have been made so prosperous if the people had not been gifted in a high degree with those&nbsp;qualities.</p>
      <p>Caution, foresight and reflection have entered largely into the Scottish character. Under the influence of these qualities they are slow and sometimes cold in speech, and are therefore apt to appear as deficient in frankness and generosity. These, however, are only appearances. As the Scottish people admit they do not like to spend money, but they like spending money on their friends and visitors not on&nbsp;themselves.</p>
      <p>There is no other part of the British Isles where national spirit is stronger, national pride is more intense and national traditions are more cherished than in Wales. The Welsh considered a person to be Welsh if he fits for a country whose national anthem is <i>Land of My Fathers</i> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kUnCwV3AYE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Welsh&nbsp;Anthem</a>).</p>
      <p>Different ethnic groups and tribes that settled in ancient Wales gradually merged, politically and culturally, to defend their territory first from the Romans, later from Anglo-Saxon and Norman invaders. The sense of national identity was formed and strengthened over&nbsp;centuries.</p>
      <p>Visitors to Wales admit that the Welsh are generally quiet, reserved, and introverted. But a great majority of tourists who had a chance to attend the Eisteddfod, a cultural gathering celebrating music, poetry, and storytelling and other competitions of this kind say that the Welsh are poetic, musical, passionate and amazingly romantic. They preserved their highly developed artistic sense. The tradition of handing down poetry and stories orally and the importance of music in daily life were essential to the culture’s&nbsp;survival.</p>
      <p>The Irish are different from the Scots, Welsh and English. They are reputed optimistic, “leg-pulling” and ironic. The Irish humour is unique. The Irish philosophy is full of optimism like in the following quote: “There are only two things to worry about, either you are healthy or you are sick. If you are healthy, then there is nothing to worry about. But if you are sick there are only two things to worry about, either you will get well or you will die. If you get well, then there is nothing to worry about. But if you die there are only two things to worry about, either you will go to heaven or to hell. If you go to heaven, then there is nothing to worry about. And if you to go hell, you’ll be so darn busy shaking hands with your friends you won’t have time to&nbsp;worry.”</p>
      <p>People are attracted to the Irish because of their hospitality, frankness, sharp wit and kind-heartedness. They are naturally warm and want to be&nbsp;helpful.</p>

        <img src="../img/10-8.jpg" alt="Storytelling in the pub">
        <figcaption>Storytelling in the pub</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Many Irish people have a wonderful power of memory in telling stories. The tradition of storytelling is almost as ancient as Ireland itself. Storytelling was a favourite art and amusement among the Gaelic-speaking people of Ireland and even today you can see many people gather in the pub especially in the countryside to listen to talented&nbsp;storytellers.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t5" style="clear: both;">A National Passion</h3>
      <p>Sport probably plays a more important part in people’s lives in Britain than it does in most other countries. For a very large number it is their main form of entertainment. Millions take part in this or that kind of sport at least once a week. Many millions more are regular spectators and follow one or more sports. There are hours of televised sport each week. Every newspaper, national or local, quality or popular, devotes several pages entirely to&nbsp;sport.</p>
      <p>This great, sports-loving country is widely recognized as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school&nbsp;curriculum.</p>
      <p>Most of the major sports have separate administrative structures and national teams for each of the countries of the United Kingdom but there is a single ‘Team GB’ that represents the UK at the Olympic&nbsp;Games.</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom has played an essential role in the inception, growth, and development of some of the world’s most popular sports such as football, cricket, golf, rugby, and&nbsp;tennis.</p>
      <p>The origin of football can be traced to English public school football games. However, it has been played since the 8<sup>th</sup> century. It was so popular in the Middle Ages that some kings banned it because the players became very angry and noisy and it stopped men from preparing for war! The rules were first drafted in England in&nbsp;1863. The first international football match was between England and Scotland in&nbsp;1870. The UK has the oldest football clubs in the world. Teams at the top of the English Premier Football league are very rich and have some of the best players in the world. The ‘Big Four’ teams are Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and&nbsp;Liverpool.</p>

        <figcaption>A game of golf</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The modern game of golf originated in Scotland. The town of Fife is known internationally as the “home of golf” dating to 1574. The oldest golf tournament in the world, and the first major championship in golf, The Open Championship, first took place in Scotland in&nbsp;1860.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;1845, rugby union was created when the first rules were written by pupils at Rugby School, Warwickshire. The first rugby international took place in&nbsp;1871.</p>
      <p>The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham in the 1860s, and after its creation tennis spread throughout the upper-class English-speaking population, before spreading around the world. The world’s oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon championships, first occurred in&nbsp;1877, and today the event takes place over two weeks in late June and early&nbsp;July.</p>
      <p>The modern game of cricket was created in England in the 1830s. In&nbsp;1882, the Australians beat the English for the first time. The English were so upset that the newspapers said that English cricket was dead and was cremated. Since then, the matches, between Australia and England have been called ‘the Ashes’. Cricket matches can last for five days, four days or one day. <a href="7.1.html#grace">W.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Grace</a> is regarded as one of the greatest cricket players, devising most of the techniques of modern&nbsp;batting.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Because horse breeding has long been part of the British legacy, it is only natural to have horse racing as an esteemed part of the society. In fact, it is the second largest spectator sport in Britain. Horse racing events include the Royal Ascot, Grand National and the Cheltenham Festival. The <b>Grand National</b> is one of the most awaited horse racing events every year. The history of racing horses dates back to the 12<sup>th</sup> century when the English knights carried Arab horses on their way back from the Crusades. These horses, cross bred with the English horses, gave birth to the Thoroughbred horse which is the breed being used in racing in the&nbsp;UK.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t6" style="clear: both;">Britain’s National Costumes</h3>
      <p>As a multinational state, the UK has no single national costume. However, different countries within the United Kingdom have national costumes or at least are associated with styles of&nbsp;dress.</p>
      <p>Although England is a country rich in folklore and traditions, it has no definite national costume. The topic of a national costume has been in debate, since no officially recognized clothing is “national”. However, the closest to a national costume can be the smock or smock-frock. English Country Clothing is also very popular among rural folk, flat caps and brogue shoes also forming part of the country&nbsp;clothing.</p>

      <p>The most well-known folk costumes are those of the Morris dancers. They can be seen in many country villages during the summer months performing folk dances that once held ritualistic and magical meanings associated with the awakening of the earth. The costume varies from team to team, but basically consists of white trousers, a white shirt, a pad of bells worn around the calf of the leg, and a hat made of felt or straw, decorated with ribbons and flowers. The bells and ribbons are said to banish harm and bring&nbsp;fertility.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Perhaps the most famous national costume in Britain is the Scottish kilt with its distinctive tartan pattern. The kilt is a length of woollen cloth, pleated except for sections at each end. The kilt is worn around the waist, with the pleats at the back and the ends crossed over at the front and secured with a&nbsp;pin.</p>
      <p>Each Scottish Clan or family has its own distinctive tartan pattern, made up of different colours. The kilt forms part of the traditional Highland dress, worn by Scottish clansmen and Scottish regiments. In addition to the kilt, a plaid or tartan cloak is worn over one shoulder, and a goatskin pouch or sporran is worn at the front of the kilt. Sometimes tartan trousers or trews are worn instead of a kilt. Women do not have their own distinctive national dress in Scotland, although tartan fabrics are widely used in clothing, and the kilt is also&nbsp;worn.</p>

      <p>The national costume of Wales is based on the peasant costume of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Because Wales was isolated geographically from the rest of Britain, many of the individual traits of costume and materials were retained in Welsh dress long after they had died out&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Unlike Scotland, the distinctive folk costume of Wales was worn by the women, consisting of a long gown (bet gown) or skirt, worn with a petticoat (the favoured colour was scarlet) and topped with a shawl folded diagonally to form a triangle and draped around the shoulders, with one corner hanging down and two others pinned in front. Aprons were universally worn, sometimes simple, sometimes decorated with colourful&nbsp;embroidery.</p>
      <p>The most distinctive part of the costume was the tall black ‘Welsh hat’, thought to have originated in France at the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The hats had a tall crown, cylindrical or conical in shape with a brim, and were usually trimmed with a band of silk or&nbsp;crepe.</p>

      <p>Early Irish dress, based on Gaelic and Norse costumes, consisted of check trews for men, worn with a fringed cloak or mantle, or a short tunic for both men and women, worn with a fringed cloak. This style of dressing was prohibited in the 16<sup>th</sup> century under sumptuary laws, passed to suppress the distinctive Irish dress and so overcome Irish reluctance to become part of England. In particular, the wearing of the fringed cloak was forbidden; as was the wearing of trews or any saffron-coloured garment (saffron yellow was an important feature of Irish costume). Although a strong tradition of wearing folk costume does not survive in Northern Ireland today, folk music and folk dancing are very&nbsp;important.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t7" style="clear: both;">The British Cuisine</h3>
      <p>British cuisine has traditionally been based on beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and fish, all cooked with the minimum of decoration and generally served with potatoes and one other vegetable or, in the case of fish (most commonly cod or haddock) deep-fried in batter and served with deep-fried potato slices (chips). For middle-income households, the main family meal of the week was the “Sunday joint,” when a substantial piece of beef, lamb, or pork was roasted in the oven during the morning and served around midday. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, these traditions started to change. Immigrants from India and Hong Kong arrived with their own distinctive cuisine, and Indian and Chinese restaurants became a familiar sight in every part of the country. By the 1980s, American-style fast-food restaurants dotted the landscape, and the rapid post-World War II growth of holiday travel to Europe, particularly to France, Spain, Greece, and Italy, exposed the British to new foods, flavours and ingredients, many of which found their way into a new generation of recipe books that filled the shelves of the typical&nbsp;kitchen.</p>

      <p>International recognition of British cuisine was historically limited to the full breakfast and the Christmas dinner. The full English breakfast consists of bacon, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, baked beans, fried mushrooms, sausages and eggs. Black or white pudding and hash browns are often also included. It is usually served with tea or&nbsp;coffee.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day, goose was previously served at dinner; however since appearing on Christmas tables in England in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century, the turkey has become more popular, with Christmas pudding served for dessert. The turkey is sometimes accompanied with roast beef or ham, and is served with stuffing, gravy, roast potatoes, mashed potatoes and&nbsp;vegetables.</p>

      <p>The British population is one of the largest tea consumers in the world. Since the 18<sup>th</sup> century tea has become a prominent feature of British culture and society. Tea is usually served with milk and often accompanied with sandwiches, crumpets, scones, cakes and&nbsp;biscuits.</p>
      <img class="right" src="../img/10-17.jpg" alt="Fish chips">
      <p>Fish and chips is regarded as a national institution. Winston Churchill called the dish “the good companions”, <a href="7.1.html#orwell">George Orwell</a> referred to it as a “chief comfort” of the working class. It was created in&nbsp;1860 in London by a Jewish immigrant who came up with the idea of combining fried fish with&nbsp;chips.</p>
      <p>Curry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town. Britain’s love for curry is truly remarkable. It has been highly popularized by Queen Victoria herself. Curry houses account for a fifth of the restaurant business in the UK. Curry has become an integral part of British cuisine so much that since the late 1990s, chicken tikka masala has been referred to as “a true British national&nbsp;dish”.</p>
      <p>Chinese restaurants and takeaways in addition to Indian ones are among the most popular ethnic food in the UK. Chinese takeaways are a common sight in towns throughout the&nbsp;UK.</p>
      <p>The pub is an important aspect of British culture, and is often the focal point of local communities. They are attended in the daytime for lunch and in the evening to socialize. Pubs are usually chosen for their proximity to home or work, the availability of a particular beer or ale or a good selection, tasty food, a social atmosphere, the presence of friends and acquaintances, and the availability of pub games such as darts or snooker. Pubs often screen sports&nbsp;events.</p>
      <p>Each country within the United Kingdom has its own&nbsp;specialities.</p>
      <img class="right" src="../img/10-18.jpg" alt="Scottish meat pies">
      <p><b><i>Scottish cuisine</i></b> has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own, but shares much with British and European cuisine as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. A traditional Scottish dish is <i>haggis </i>containing sheep’s heart, liver, and lungs, minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and cooked in the animal’s stomach. Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour. The <i>Scotch pie</i> or <i>mutton pie</i> is believed to originate in Scotland but can be found in other parts of the United Kingdom. It is a small, double-crust meat pie filled with minced mutton or other meat. Scotch pies are often served hot by take-away restaurants, bakeries and at outdoor events. The hard crust of the pie enables it to be eaten by hand with no wrapping. <i>Oat porridge</i> or <i>oatmeal</i> is one of the most common types of porridge in Scotland. The Scottish cook oatmeal by soaking it overnight in salted water and boiling on a low heat in the morning for a few minutes until the mixture&nbsp;thickens.</p>
      <p><b><i>Irish cuisine</i></b> takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in its temperate climate. The introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century heavily influenced Ireland’s cuisine thereafter. Representative traditional Irish dishes include Irish stew (made with lamb, mutton, or beef), bacon and cabbage (with potatoes), boxty (potato pancake), coddle (sausage, bacon, and potato) and colcannon (mashed potato, kale or cabbage, and&nbsp;butter).</p>
      <p>Traditionally, the most common ingredients of <i>the full Irish breakfast</i> are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried or scrambled eggs, white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomatoes. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included as well as baked beans, hash browns and brown soda&nbsp;bread.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Modern Irish food still uses traditional ingredients but they are now being cooked by chefs with world influences and are presented in a more modern artistic style. In <i>Irish stew</i> which is a celebrated Irish dish basic ingredients include lamb or mutton as well as potatoes, onions and parsley, sometimes carrots which are boiled and simmered slowly for up to two hours on an open oven. <i>Black pudding</i> is a type of blood made from pork blood, with pork fat or beef suet and a cereal, usually oatmeal oat or barley groats along with the use of certain herbs such as pennyroyal. <i>Shepherd’s pie</i> (refers to lamb filling) or <i>cottage pie</i> (refers to beef filling) is a meat pie cooked in a gravy or sauce with onions and sometimes other vegetables, such as peas, celery or carrots, and topped with a layer of mashed potato before it is baked. The pie is sometimes also topped with grated&nbsp;cheese.</p>
      <p>In <b><i>Welsh cuisine</i></b> there are many dishes that can be considered Welsh due to their ingredients and history. Such dishes as <i>cawl</i>, <i>Welsh rabbit</i>, <i>laverbread</i>, <i>Welsh cakes</i>, <i>bara brith</i> and the <i>Glamorgan sausage</i> have all been regarded as symbols of Welsh food. While some dishes have been imported from its British neighbours, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from the lives of Welsh working people as a result of the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Vegetables, except cabbages and leeks, were historically rare and the leek became a significant component of many dishes. At present sheep farming is practiced extensively in Wales, with lamb and mutton being the meats most traditionally associated with the country. Beef and dairy cattle are also raised&nbsp;widely.</p>
      <img class="right" src="../img/10-20.jpg" alt="Welsh rabbit">
      <p>Despite the name the dish <i>Welsh rabbit</i> contains no rabbit meat. It is a traditional Welsh dish made with a savoury sauce of melted cheese and various other ingredients and served hot, after being poured over slices of toasted bread. The main ingredients of a traditional Welsh vegetarian dish <i>Glamorgan sausage</i> are cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs. It is named after the historic county of Glamorgan in Wales. <i>Cawl</i> is recognised as a national dish of Wales. In modern Welsh language the word is used to refer to any soup or broth. Historically, ingredients tended to vary, but the most common recipes are with lamb or beef with leeks, potatoes, swedes, carrots and other seasonal&nbsp;vegetables.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t8" style="clear: both;">Enjoying Free Time</h3>
      <p>British people spend their free time in different ways. The range of activities is very diverse. According to one of the British Attitudes Survey watching television is Britain’s most common leisure activity, with 90&nbsp;% of the population watching several times a week. ‘Watching television’ ranges from recovering-from-exhaustion-on-the-family-sofa to intense shared experiences where everyone is sitting in the near-darkness, pop-eyed with excitement. By contrast, only 42&nbsp;% read a book several times a&nbsp;week.</p>
      <p>Younger people turn to computers, partly for games but increasingly to enjoy social-networking sites. Perhaps the most popular activities are using mobile phones and exchanging news on sites such as Facebook and My Space. Meanwhile older people are fast catching up; pensioners are not interested in computer games but are learning to use the internet in order to follow up their own interests, for example, discovering the history of their&nbsp;family.</p>
      <p>Listening to popular music is as widespread in Britain as anywhere. One distinctive thing about British attitudes to music is that&nbsp;– along with the USA&nbsp;– they are its ‘history’: Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Who, Sex Pistols and on and on. The success of these groups can make the British very&nbsp;self-satisfied.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/10-21.jpg" alt="The English home">
        <figcaption>The English home</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These leisure-time activities occur mostly inside the house. Outside, the British are indeed a nation of gardeners. Almost all houses have a small garden and the climate is ideal for growing plants from most parts of the world. They have a passion for lawns of grass which stay green throughout the year. For really enthusiastic gardeners who want more land, it is possible to rent an allotment from the local&nbsp;authority.</p>
      <p>‘Eating out’ is characteristic of this affluent society. In practice it can mean sitting around a table with friends in a pizzeria or a simple cafe; it can mean eating at a very expensive, exclusive restaurant but obviously that is for the very few. Tens of thousands of pubs provide cheap but decent bar meals especially at lunchtime; cafes, restaurant and food-chain shops line their streets. Sometimes, in good weather, cafes and restaurants put out tables on the pavement or in a little garden, but too often the rain and wind disappoint&nbsp;them.</p>
      <p>Families with small children have their own priorities. Most parents try to spend as much time as they can with their children in two typical ways. The first is to read to the child or children, usually at bedtime. The second is to go out for a walk, as a family, on Saturdays and Sundays. The ‘walk’ may be to the local playground equipped with swings, slides, climbing frames, often constructed alongside a public space for playing family football, cricket or simply running around. Sometimes the walk may be to a large municipal park, or to a local pond or lake ‘to feed the ducks’. As children get older, families may make expeditions to fairs, local celebrations or&nbsp;– if they live close to the sea&nbsp;– to the seaside. In any town on any weekend some group or other will be performing or displaying crafts or organising a public party or arranging special activities for children. Town festivals and art shows are increasingly popular ways of bringing people together. Some families choose to visit museums. British national art and antiquity collections are free to&nbsp;everyone.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of people join amateur choirs and orchestras, act in amateur theatrical performances or contribute paintings to amateur art exhibitions (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppWpdIqSRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Window on Britain:&nbsp;Leisure</a>).</p>
