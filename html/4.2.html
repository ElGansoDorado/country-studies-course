      <h2 class="uppercase">Settlement of the British Isles</h2>

      <p>Britain has not always been an island. It became one only after the end of the last Ice Age. The temperature rose and the ice cap melted, flooding the lower-lying land that is now under the North Sea and the English Channel.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t1">Ancient Britain</h3>
      <p>The story of ancient Britain is traditionally seen as one of successive waves of settlers from the continent, bringing with them new cultures and technologies. Little is known about the ancient population of the British Isles. Archeological remains which date back to about 8500 BC show that at that time Britain was peopled by small groups of hunters, gatherers and fishers. They seem to have followed herds of deer which provided them with food and clothing. By about 5000 BC Britain had finally become an island, and had also become heavily forested.</p>
      <p>In the course of time, different groups of people kept arriving in Britain, bringing their customs and skills. About 3000 BC Neolithic (or New Stone Age) people crossed the narrow sea from Europe in small round boats of bent wood covered with animal skins. Each could carry one or two persons.</p>
      <p>Those people kept animals and grew corn crops, and knew how to make pottery. They probably came from either the Iberian (Spanish) peninsula or even the North African coast and settled in the western parts of Britain and Ireland. They were small, dark, and long-headed, and may be the forefathers of dark-haired inhabitants of Wales and Cornwall today.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As they settled on the chalk uplands of south Britain they are called chalkland people. Today these uplands have poor soil and few trees, but they were not like that then. They were airy woodlands that could easily be cleared for farming, and as a result were the most easily habitable part of the countryside. After 3000 BC the chalkland people started building great circles of earth banks and ditches. Inside, they built wooden buildings and stone circles. These “henges”, as they are called, were centres of religious, political and economic power. By far the most spectacular, both then and now, was Stonehenge, which was built between 3100 and 1550 BC north of Salisbury, England. The precise purposes of Stonehenge remain a mystery. It is believed to have served varied purposes – a temple for sky worship; a calendar; an instrument to foretell solar eclipses, etc. But for sure Stonehenge was almost certainly a sort of capital, to which the chiefs of other groups came from all over Britain. Certainly, earth or stone henges were built in many parts of Britain, as far as the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, and as far south as Cornwall. They seem to have been copies of the great Stonehenge in the south (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-m_g5JUO88" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Solving the Mystery of Stonehenge with Dan Snow</a>).</p>
      <p>Nowadays Stonehenge is not only a tourist attraction. It functions as a gathering point for some minority groups (the hippies, new age travellers). The main thing is now to protect stones from damage (because some years ago some minority group made a fire in the middle of Stonehenge and damaged a lot of stones.) Some people say that if you touch some stone you’ll be happy.</p>
      <p>After 2400 BC new groups of people arrived in south-east Britain from Europe, probably originally from Spain. They were round-headed and strongly built, taller than Neolithic Britons. It is not known whether they invaded by armed force, or whether they were invited by Neolithic Britons because of their military or metal-working skills. Their influence was soon felt and, as a result, they became leaders of British society.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/2-2.jpg" alt="A selection of Beaker pottery">
        <figcaption>A selection of Beaker pottery</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Their arrival is marked by the first individual graves, furnished with pottery beakers, from which those people got their name: the “Beaker” people.</p>
      <p>Why did those people decide to be buried separately and give up the old communal burial barrows? It is difficult to be certain, but it is thought that the old barrows were built partly to please the gods of the soil, in the hope that this would stop the chalk upland soil getting poorer. The Beaker people brought with them a new cereal, barley, which could grow almost anywhere. Perhaps they felt it was no longer necessary to please the gods of the chalk upland soil.</p>
      <p>The Beaker people probably spoke an Indo-European language. They seem to have brought a single culture to the whole of Britain. They also brought skills to make bronze tools and they began to replace stone ones. But they accepted many of the old ways. Stonehenge remained the most important centre until 1300 BC. The Beaker people’s richest graves were there, and they added a new circle of thirty stone columns, this time connected by stone lintels, or cross-pieces. British society continued to be centred on a number of henges across the countryside.</p>
      <p>However, from about 1300 BC onwards the henge civilisation seems to have become less important, and was overtaken by a new form of society in southern England, that of a settled farming class. At first that farming society developed in order to feed the people at the henges, but eventually it became more important and powerful as it grew richer. The new farmers grew wealthy because they learned to enrich the soil with natural waste materials so that it did not become poor and useless. Family villages and fortified enclosures appeared across the landscape, and the old central control of Stonehenge and the other henges was lost.</p>
      <p>From that time, too, power seems to have shifted to the Thames valley and south-east Britain. <i>Hill-forts</i> replaced <i>henges </i>as the centres of local power, and most of them were found in the southeast, suggesting that the land successfully supported more people here than elsewhere.</p>
      <p>There was another reason for the shift of power eastwards. A number of better-designed bronze swords have been found in the Thames valley, suggesting that the local people had more advanced metalworking skills. Many of the swords have been found in river beds, almost certainly thrown in for religious reasons. This custom may be the origin of the story of the legendary King Arthur’s sword, which was given to him from out of the water and which was thrown back into the water when he died.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t2">The Celts</h3>
      <p>Around 700 BC, another group of people began to arrive. Many of them were tall, and had fair or red hair and blue eyes. They were the Celts, who probably came from central Europe or further east, from southern Russia, and had moved slowly westwards in earlier centuries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrmqECOhVPg0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Britain’s Celtic Tribes</a>). The Celts were technically advanced. They knew how to work with iron, and could make better weapons than the people who used bronze.</p>
      <p>The Celts came in three distinct waves:</p>
      <p>1) the <i>Goidels </i>or <i>Gaels</i>, who were driven by later invaders into the less fertile and more mountainous western and northern regions (the original language of Ireland and of north-west Scotland is Goidelic Celtic (<i>Gaelic)</i>;</p>
      <p>2) the Brythonic Celts or <i>Brythons</i>, from whose name the word Britain is derived, settled in the south of England, in Wales and in north-west England and south-west Scotland (their language developed into the Celtic language of modern Wales);</p>
      <p>3) <i>Belgae</i> from northern Gaul arrived about 100 BC and occupied the greater part of central Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Our knowledge of the Celts is slight. We do not even know for certain whether the Celts invaded Britain or came peacefully as a result of the lively trade with Europe. At first most of Celtic Britain seems to have developed in a generally similar way. But from about 500 BC trade contact with Europe declined, and regional differences between north-west and south-east Britain increased. As for the last Celtic arrivals from Europe, the Belgae tribes, they were different from the elder inhabitants. They probably pushed other Celtic tribes northwards. At any rate, when <a href="7.1.html#caesar">Julius Caesar</a> briefly visited Britain in 55 BC he saw that the Celts were organised into different tribes, and tribal chiefs were chosen from each family or tribe, sometimes as the result of fighting matches between individuals, and sometimes by election.</p>
      <figure class="left">

        <figcaption>Maiden Castle, Dorset, one of the largest Celtic hill-forts of the early Iron Age</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Celtic tribes continued the same kind of agriculture as the Bronze Age people before them. But their use of iron technology and their introduction of more advanced ploughing methods made it possible for them to farm heavier soils. However, they continued to use and build hill-forts. Their increase, particularly in the south-east, suggests that the Celts were highly successful farmers, growing enough food for a much larger population. The hill-fort remained the centre for local groups. The insides of those hill-forts were filled with houses, and they became the simple economic capitals and smaller “towns” of different tribal areas into which Britain was now divided.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/2-4.jpg" alt="Ancient Celtic coinage of Britain">
        <figcaption>Ancient Celtic coinage of Britain</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Celts traded across tribal borders and trade was probably important for political and social contact between the tribes. Trade with Ireland went through the island of Anglesey. The two main trade outlets eastwards to Europe were the settlements along the Thames River in the south and on the Firth of Forth in the north. It is no accident that the present-day capitals of England and Scotland stand on or near those two ancient trade centres. Much trade, both inside and beyond Britain, was conducted by river and sea. For money the Celts used iron bars, until they began to copy the Roman coins they saw used in Gaul (France).</p>
      <p>According to the Romans, the Celtic men wore shirts and breeches (knee-length trousers), and striped or checked cloaks fastened by a pin. It is possible that the Scottish tartan and dress developed from that “striped cloak”. The Celts were also “very careful about cleanliness and neatness”, as one Roman wrote. “Neither man nor woman,” he went on, “however poor, was seen either ragged or dirty.”</p>
      <p>The Celtic tribes were ruled over by a warrior class, of which the priests, or <i>Druids,</i> seem to have been particularly important members (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkvoKrCBJao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Druids: A Very Short Introduction</a>). The Druids could not read or write, but they memorised all the religious teachings, the tribal laws, history, medicine and other knowledge necessary in Celtic society. The Druids from different tribes all over Britain probably met once a year. They had no temples, but they met in sacred groves of trees, on certain hills, by rivers or by river sources. They worshiped the sun. Stonehenge was used by druids perform different religious ceremonies when the appropriate day of a year came (the most important one was June 21).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>During the Celtic period women may have had more independence than they had again for hundreds of years. When the Romans invaded Britain two of the largest tribes were ruled by women who fought from their chariots. The most powerful Celt to stand up to the Romans was a woman, <a href="7.1.html#boadicea">Boadicea</a>. She became queen of her tribe when her husband had died. She was tall, with long red hair, and had a frightening appearance. In 61 AD she led her tribe against the Romans. She nearly drove them from Britain, and she destroyed London, the Roman capital, before she was defeated.</p>
      <p>The Celts are important in British history because they are the ancestors of many of the people in Highland Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Cornwall today. The Iberian people of Wales and Cornwall took on the new Celtic culture. Celtic languages have still been spoken in some areas since that time.</p>
      <p>Celtic presence in the English language is not abundant and found mostly in place-names, e. g. <i>Kent</i>,<i> York</i>, as well as the names of the rivers <i>Ouse</i>,<i> Esk</i>,<i> Avon</i>,<i> Thames</i>,<i> Dover</i>, etc. Some of the Celtic borrowings have survived only in dialects, e. g. <i>loch </i>‘lake’.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t3">The Romans</h3>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/2-6.jpg" alt="Julius Caesar">
        <figcaption>Julius Caesar</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Julius Caesar first came to Britain in 55 BC but it was not until almost a century later, in 43 AD that a Roman army actually occupied Britain. The Romans were determined to conquer the whole island. They had little difficulty, apart from Boadicea’s revolt, because they had a better trained army and because the Celtic tribes fought among themselves.</p>
      <p>The Romans invaded because the Celts of Britain were working with the Celts of Gaul against them. The British Celts gave them food, and allowed them to hide in Britain. There was another reason. The Celts used cattle to pull ploughs to farm heavy soil. As a result they could produce more food. The Romans wanted to make use of British food for their own army fighting the Gauls (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv9tldc6Kuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">6 Reasons Why the Romans Invaded Britain</a>).</p>
      <p>The Romans brought the skills of reading and writing to Britain. The written word was important for spreading ideas and also for establishing power. Britain was probably more literate under the Romans than it was to be again until the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
      <p>The Romans established a Romano-British culture across the southern half of Britain, from the River Humber to the River Severn. This part of Britain was inside the empire. Beyond were the upland areas, under Roman control but not developed. Those areas were watched from the towns of York, Chester and Caerleon in the western peninsula of Britain that later became known as Wales. Each of these towns was held by a Roman legion of about 7,000 men. The total Roman army in Britain was about 40,000 men (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0R0s0TYlE4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The British Celts and the Romans</a>).</p>

      <p>The Romans could not conquer “Caledonia”, as they called Scotland, although they spent over a century trying to do so. At last they built a strong wall along the northern border, named after the Emperor <a href="7.1.html#hadrian">Hadrian</a> who planned it. At the time, Hadrian’s Wall was simply intended to keep out raiders from the north. But it also marked the border between the two later countries, England and Scotland.</p>

      <p>The most obvious characteristic of Roman Britain was its towns, which were the basis of Roman administration and civilization. Many grew out of Celtic settlements, military camps or market centres. There were three different kinds of towns in Roman Britain: the <i>colonie</i>, towns peopled by Roman settlers, and the <i>municipia</i>, large cities in which the whole population was given Roman citizenship and the third kind, the <i>civitas</i>, included the old Celtic tribal capitals, through which the Romans administered the Celtic population in the countryside. At first those towns had no walls. Then, probably from the end of the second century to the end of the third century AD, almost every town was given walls. At first many of them were no more than earthworks, but by 300 AD all towns had thick stone walls.</p>
      <p>The Romans left about twenty large towns of about 5,000 inhabitants, and almost one hundred smaller ones. Many of the towns were army camps and the Latin word for camp, <i>castra</i>, has remained part of town names to this day (with the ending -<i>chester</i>, -<i>caster</i> or -<i>fester</i>): Gloucester, Leicester, Lancaster, Winchester, Chester, Lancaster and many others. The towns were built of stone as well as wood, and had planned streets, markets and shops. Some buildings had central heating. The towns were connected by roads which were so well built that they survived and continued to be used long after the Romans left, and became the main roads of modern Britain. Six of those Roman roads met in London, a capital city of about 20,000 people. London was twice the size of Paris, and possibly the most important trading centre of northern Europe, because south-east Britain produced so much corn for export.</p>
      <p>Outside the towns, the biggest change during the Roman occupation was the growth of large farms, called “villas”. They belonged to the richer Britons who were, like the townspeople, more Roman than Celt in their manners. Each villa had many workers. The villas were usually close to towns so that the crops could be sold easily. There was a growing difference between the rich and those who did the actual work on the land. Most people still lived in the same kind of round huts and villages which the Celts had been living in 400 years earlier, when the Romans arrived.</p>
      <p>In some ways life in Roman Britain seemed very civilized, but it was also hard for all except the richest. The bodies buried in a Roman graveyard at York show that life expectancy was low. Half the entire population died between the ages of twenty and forty, while 15 % died before reaching the age of twenty. It is very difficult to be sure how many people were living in Britain when the Romans left. Probably it was as many as five million, partly because of the peace and the increased economic life which the Romans had brought to the country. The new wave of invaders changed all that.</p>
      <p>So, the Roman occupation lasted nearly 400 years and came to an end in the early 5<sup>th</sup> century AD when the Roman troops were withdrawn from Britain due to internal and external causes. After the departure of the Romans, Britain remained unprotected from numerous enemies surrounding it such as the Picts and Scots from Scotland and Ireland and Germanic tribes from the mainland which made raids on the British shores. The wealth of Britain, the result of its mild climate and centuries of peace, was a temptation to the greedy. Besides, the Britons fought among themselves which also weakened the country. So it is quite natural that they were unable to offer resistance to the enemies that attacked them in the middle of the 5<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t4">The Anglo-Saxon Invasion</h3>
      <p>According to Venerable <a href="7.1.html#bede">Bede</a> (673–735), an ancient monastic scholar and historian who wrote the first history of Britain (<i>Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</i>), the invaders came to Britain under the leadership of two Germanic kings, <a href="7.1.html#hengist">Hengist and Horsa</a>; they had been invited by a British king as assistants and allies in a local war. They came in multitude, in families and clans, to settle in the occupied territories (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p9H4yPzKoA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Anglo-Saxon Arrival – The Fifth Century in Post-Roman Britain</a>).</p>
      <p>The newcomers were of three strongest races of Germany, the Saxons, the Angles and the Jutes. It is uncertain whether they belonged to different tribes or perhaps constituted two mixed waves of invaders differing mainly in the place and time of arrival. They were called Angles and Saxons by the Romans and by the Celts but preferred to call themselves <i>Angelcyn</i> (English people) and applied that name to the conquered territories: Angelcynnes land (land of the English), hence England.</p>
      <p>The conquerors settled in Britain in the following way: the Jutes or Frisians settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight; the Saxons occupied territories south of the Thames and some stretches north of it, and depending on location were called South Saxons, West Saxons and East Saxons (late also Mid Saxons). The Saxons consolidated into a number of petty kingdoms, the largest and most powerful of which was Wessex, the kingdom of West Saxons. The last people to settle in Britain were the Angles which occupied most of the territory north of the Thames up to the Firth of Forth, namely the districts between the Wash and the Humber, and to the North of Humber.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/2-9.jpg" alt="The Anglo-Saxon invasion">
        <figcaption>The Anglo-Saxon invasion</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Since the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain the ties of their language with the continent were broken, and its further development went its own ways. It is at that time, in the 5<sup>th</sup> century, that the history of the English language began. The Anglos-Saxons occupied the territory of modern England and part of Scotland while Wales, Ireland, the Scottish Highlands and Cornwall remained Celtic.</p>
      <p>In the course of the struggle of the Celts against the Anglo-Saxons many legends emerged of which most famous is the legend of the Court of <a href="7.1.html#arthur">King Arthur</a>.</p>
      <p>The Germanic tribes founded seven separate kingdoms, which during four centuries struggled with one another for supremacy. They were Kent, Sussex, Essex, Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia and Northumbria. In this prolonged struggle it was sometimes Kent, or Northumbria and sometimes Mercia and Wessex that would take the upper hand. In 828 the struggle came to an end with the decisive victory of Wessex. <a href="7.1.html#ecgbert">Ecgbert</a>, king of Wessex, subdued Mercia and Northumbria. Since then kings of Wessex became kings of England, and the capital of Wessex, Winchester, became the capital of England.</p>
      <p>The British Celts fought the raiders and settlers from Germany as well as they could. However, during the next hundred years they were slowly pushed westwards. Finally most were driven into the mountains in the far west, which the Saxons called “Wellas”, or “Wales”, meaning “the land of foreigners”. Some Celts were driven into Cornwall, where they later accepted the rule of Saxon lords. In the north, other Celts were driven into the lowlands of the country which became known as Scotland. Some Celts stayed behind, and many became slaves of the Saxons.</p>
      <p>The strength of Anglo-Saxon culture is obvious even today. Days of the week were named after Germanic gods: Tig (Tuesday), Wodin (Wednesday), Thor (Thursday), Frei (Friday). New place-names appeared on the map. The earliest Saxon villages, like the Celtic ones, were family villages. The ending -<i>ing</i> meant folk or family, thus “Reading” is the place of the family of Rada, “Hastings” of the family of Hasta. <i>Ham</i> means ‘farm’, <i>ton</i> means ‘settlement’. Birmingham, Nottingham or Southampton, for example, are Saxon place-names. Because the Anglo-Saxon kings often established settlements, Kingston is a frequent place-name.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/2-10.jpg" alt="The Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms">
        <figcaption>The Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Anglo-Saxons established a number of kingdoms, some of which still exist in county or regional names to this day: Essex (East Saxons), Sussex (South Saxons), Wessex (West Saxons), Middlesex (probably a kingdom of Middle Saxons), East Anglia (East Angles). By the middle of the 7<sup>th</sup> century the three largest kingdoms, those of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, were the most powerful.</p>
      <p>It was not until a century later that one of these kings, King <a href="7.1.html#offa">Offa</a> of Mercia (757–796), claimed “kingship of the English”. He had good reason to do so. He was powerful enough to employ thousands of men to build a huge dyke, or earth wall, the length of the Welsh border to keep out the troublesome Celts. But although he was the most powerful king of his time, he did not control all of England.</p>
      <p>The power of Mercia did not survive after Offa’s death. At that time, a king’s power depended on the personal loyalty of his followers. After his death the next king had to work hard to rebuild these personal feelings of loyalty. Most people still believed, as the Celts had done, that a man’s first duty was to his own family. However, things were changing. The Saxon kings began to replace loyalty to family with loyalty to lord and king.</p>
      <p>The Saxons created institutions which made the English state strong for the next 500 years. One of these institutions was the King’s Council, called the Witan. The Witan probably grew out of informal groups of senior warriors and churchmen to who kings like Offa had turned for advice or support on difficult matters. By the 10<sup>th</sup> century the Witan was a formal body, issuing laws and charters. It was not at all democratic, and the king could decide to ignore the Witan’s advice, but he knew that it might be dangerous to do so for the Witan’s authority was based on its right to choose kings, and to agree on the use of the king’s laws. Without its support the king’s own authority was in danger. The Witan established a system which remained an important part of the king’s method of government. Even today, the king or queen has a Privy Council, a group of advisers on the affairs of the state.</p>
      <p>The Saxons divided the land into new administrative areas, based on shires, or counties. Those shires, established by the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century, remained almost exactly the same for a thousand years. “Shire” is a Saxon word, “county” is a Norman one, but both are still used. A shire reeve, the king’s local administrator, was appointed over each shire. In time his name became shortened to “sheriff”.</p>
      <p>Anglo-Saxon technology changed the shape of English agriculture. The Celts had kept small, square fields which were well suited to the plough drawn either by an animal or two people. The Celtic plough could turn corners easily. The Anglo-Saxons introduced a far heavier plough which was better able to plough in long straight lines across the field. It was particularly useful for cultivating much heavier soils. But it required six or eight oxen to pull it, and it was difficult to turn. This heavier plough led to changes in land ownership and organisation. In order to make the best use of village land, it was divided into two or three very large fields. They were then divided again into long thin strips. Each family had a number of strips in each of the fields, amounting probably to a family “holding” of twenty or so acres. Ploughing those long thin strips was easier because it avoided the problem of turning. Few individual families could afford to keep a team of oxen, and they had to be shared on a cooperative basis.</p>
      <p>One of those fields would be used for planting spring crops, and another for autumn crops. The third area would be left to rest for a year, and with the other areas after harvest, would be used as common land for animals to feed on. This Anglo-Saxon pattern, which became more and more common, was the basis of English agriculture for a thousand years, until the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The Saxons settled previously unfarmed areas. They cut down many forested areas in valleys to farm the richer lowland soil, and began to drain the wet land.</p>
      <p>In each district there was a “manor” or large house. This was a simple building where local villagers came to pay taxes, where justice was administered, and where men met together to join the Anglo-Saxon army, the <i>fyrd</i>. The lord of the manor had to organize all that, and make sure the village land was properly shared. It was the beginning of the manorial system which reached its fullest development under the Normans.</p>
      <p>At first the lords, or <i>aldermen</i>, were simply local officials. But by the beginning of the 11<sup>th</sup> century they were warlords, and were often called by a new Danish name, <i>earl</i>. Both words, alderman and earl, remain with us today: aldermen are elected officers in local government, and earls are high ranking nobles. It was the beginning of a class system, made up of the king, lords, soldiers and workers on the land. One other important class developed during the Saxon period, the men of learning. They came from the Christian Church.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t5">The Spread of Christianity</h3>
      <p>In the last hundred years of Roman government Christianity became firmly established across Britain, both in Roman-controlled areas and beyond. However, the Anglo-Saxons belonged to an older Germanic religion, and they drove the Celts into the west and north. In the Celtic areas Christianity continued to spread, bringing paganism to an end. The map of Wales shows a number of place-names beginning or ending with -<i>llan</i>, meaning the site of a small Celtic monastery around which a village or town grew.</p>
      <p>In 597 Pope Gregory the Great sent a monk, <a href="7.1.html#augustine">Augustine</a>, to re-establish Christianity in England. He went to Canterbury, the capital of the king of Kent. He did so because the king’s wife came from Europe and was already a Christian. Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in 601. He was very successful. Several ruling families in England accepted Christianity. But Augustine and his group of monks made little progress with the ordinary people. This was partly because Augustine was interested in establishing Christian authority, and that meant bringing rulers to the new faith.</p>
      <p>It was the Celtic Church which brought Christianity to the ordinary people of Britain. The Celtic bishops went out from their monasteries of Wales, Ireland and Scotland, walking from village to village teaching Christianity. In spite of the differences between Anglo-Saxons and Celts, these bishops seem to have been readily accepted in Anglo-Saxon areas. The bishops from the Roman Church lived at the courts of kings, which they made centres of Church power across England. The two Christian Churches, Celtic and Roman, could hardly have been more different in character. One was most interested in the hearts of ordinary people, while the other was interested in authority and organisation. The competition between the Celtic and Roman Churches reached a crisis because they disagreed over the date of Easter. In 663 at the Synod (meeting) of Whitby the king of Northumbria decided to support the Roman Church. The Celtic Church retreated as Rome extended its authority over all Christians, even in the Celtic parts of the island.</p>

      <p>Curiously, the spread of Christianity is also associated with the activities of St. Patrick, the national saint of Ireland. He was probably born in Wales, the son of a Roman father. Patrick became a monk in Gaul (= France) and went to Ireland in 432 AD. He converted many people to Christianity, and there are many stories about his great powers, including one which explains why there are no snakes in Ireland. Patrick is said to have tricked them all so that they went into the sea and drowned. He is also said to have used the shamrock plant to explain the Christian idea of the Trinity, because it has three leaves on one stem. That is why it is traditional for Irish people to wear a shamrock on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17.</p>
      <p>England became Christian very quickly. By 660 only Sussex and the Isle of Wight had not accepted the new faith. Saxon kings helped the Church to grow, but the Church also increased the power of kings. Bishops gave kings their support, which made it harder for royal power to be questioned. Kings had “God’s approval”. The value of Church approval was all the greater because of the uncertainty of the royal succession. An eldest son did not automatically become king, as kings were chosen from among the members of the royal family and any member who had enough soldiers might try for the throne. In addition, at a time when one king might try to conquer a neighbouring kingdom, he would probably have a son to whom he would wish to pass his enlarged kingdom when he died. And so when King Offa arranged for his son to be crowned as his successor, he made sure that this was done at a Christian ceremony led by a bishop. It was good political propaganda, because it suggested that kings were chosen not only by people but also by God.</p>
      <p>There were other ways in which the Church increased the power of the English state. It established monasteries, or minsters, for example Westminster, which were places of learning and education. Those monasteries trained the men who could read and write, so that they had the necessary skills for the growth of royal and Church authority. The king who made most use of the Church was Alfred, the great king who ruled Wessex from 871 to 899. He used the literate men of the Church to help establish a system of law, to educate the people and to write down important matters. He started the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, the most important source, for understanding the period.</p>
      <p>This process gave power into the hands of those who could read and write, and in this way class divisions were increased. The power of landlords, who had been given land by the king, was increased because their names were written down. Peasants, who could neither read nor write, could lose their traditional rights to their land, because their rights were not registered.</p>
      <p>The Anglo-Saxon kings also preferred the Roman Church to the Celtic Church for economic reasons. Villages and towns grew around the monasteries and increased local trade. Many bishops and monks in England were from France and Germany. They were invited by English rulers who wished to benefit from economic contact with Europe. Most of these bishops and monks seem to have come from churches or monasteries along Europe’s vital trade routes. In this way close contact with many parts of Europe was encouraged. In addition they all used Latin, the written language of Rome, and that encouraged English trade with the continent. Increased literacy itself helped trade. Anglo-Saxon England became well known in Europe for its exports of woollen and metal goods, cheese, hunting dogs and pottery. It imported wine, fish, pepper, and jewellery.</p>

      <p>In the 8<sup>th</sup> century raiders from Scandinavia (the Danes) made their first attacks on England. They were tempted by Britain’s wealth. They were the Vikings, a word which probably means either “pirates” or “the people of the sea inlets”, and they came from Norway and Denmark. Like the Anglo-Saxons they only raided at first. They burnt churches and monasteries along the east, north and west coasts of Britain and Ireland. London was raided in 842.</p>
      <p>When in 865 the Vikings invaded Britain it was clear that the quarrelling Anglo-Saxon kingdoms could not keep them out. This time they came to conquer and to settle. The Vikings quickly accepted Christianity and did not disturb the local population. By 875 only King Alfred in the west of Wessex held out against the Vikings, who had already taken most of England. He was strong enough to make a treaty with the Vikings. In 878, the Peace of Edington divided England in two areas.</p>
      <img class="right" src="../img/2-13.jpg" alt="The Danish Invasion">
      <p>Viking rule was recognised in the east and north of England. It was called the <i>Danelaw</i>, the land where the law of the Danes ruled. In the rest of the country Alfred was recognised as king. During his struggle against the Danes, he built walled settlements to keep them out called <i>burghs</i>. They became prosperous market towns, and the word, now usually spelt <i>borough</i> is one of the most common endings to place names, as well as the name of the unit of municipal or town administration today.</p>
      <figure class="left">

      </figure>
      <p>King Alfred is normally given credit not only for his military and diplomatic skills, but also for his literary and translating activities. Alfred is the only English monarch to be known as “the Great”. He is claimed to have saved the English language, because it was under his reign that learning and literature began to flourish in Wessex in the 9<sup>th </sup>century. He is said to have gathered a group of scholars at his court at Winchester. An erudite himself, Alfred realized that culture could reach the people only in their own tongue. He shared the contemporary view that Viking raids were a divine punishment for the people’s sins, and he attributed that to the decline of learning, for only through learning could men acquire wisdom and live in accordance with God’s will. Hence, in the lull from attack between 878 and 885, he invited scholars to his court from Mercia, Wales, and the European continent. He learned Latin himself and began to translate Latin books into English in 887. He directed that all young freemen of adequate means must learn to read English, and, by his own translations and those of his helpers, he made available English versions of “those books most necessary for all men to know,” books that would lead them to wisdom and virtue. His reign also saw activity in building and in art, and foreign craftsmen were attracted to his court.</p>
      <p>By 950 England seemed rich and peaceful again after the troubles of the Viking invasion. But soon afterwards the Danish Vikings started raiding westwards. The Saxon king, <a href="7.1.html#ethelred">Ethelred</a>, decided to pay the Vikings to stay away. To find the money he set a tax on all his people, called <i>Danegeld</i>, or “Danish money”. It was the beginning of a regular tax system of the people which would provide the money for armies. The effects of this tax were most heavily felt by the ordinary villagers, because they had to provide enough money for their village landlord to pay Danegeld.</p>
      <p>When Ethelred died, <a href="7.1.html#canute">Canute (or Cnut)</a>, the leader of the Danish Vikings, controlled much of England, though the struggle of the English against the Scandinavians lasted over 300 years. The Scandinavians subdued Northumbria and East Anglia, ravaged the eastern part of Mercia, and advanced on Wessex. He became king for the simple reason that the royal council, the Witan, and everyone else, feared disorder. Rule by a Danish king was far better than rule by no one at all (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNQM29ZUXvk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The History of the Vikings in England (AD. 793 – AD. 1066)</a>).</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t7">The Succession of the Kingship</h3>
      <p>After Canute died in 1035, and his son’s death shortly after, in 1040, the Witan chose <a href="7.1.html#edward">Edward</a>, one of Saxon Ethelred’s sons, to be king. Edward, known as “the Confessor”, was more interested in the Church than in kingship. He encouraged church building and by the time of his death there was a church in almost every village. The pattern of the English village, with its manor house and church, dates from that time. Edward started a new church fit for a king at Westminster, just outside the city of London. In fact Westminster Abbey was a Norman, not a Saxon building, because he had spent almost all his life in Normandy, and his mother was a daughter of the duke of Normandy.</p>
      <p>When Edward died without an obvious heir the question of who should follow him as king was one of the most important in English history. Edward had brought many Normans to his English court from France but those Normans were not liked by the more powerful Saxon nobles, particularly by the most powerful family of Wessex, the Godwinsons. It was a Godwinson, <a href="7.1.html#harold">Harold</a>, whom the Witan chose to be the next king of England (January 5 – 14 October 14, 1066). Harold had already shown his bravery and ability. He had no royal blood, but he seemed a good choice for the throne of England.</p>
      <p>Harold’s right to the English throne was challenged by Duke William of Normandy. William had two claims to the English throne. His first claim was that King Edward had promised it to him. The second one was that Harold, who visited William in 1064 or 1065, had promised William that he, Harold, would not try to take the throne for himself. Harold did not deny this second claim, but said that he had been forced to make the promise, and that because it had been made unwillingly he was not tied by it.</p>
      <p>Harold was faced by two dangers, one in the south and one in the north. The Danish Vikings had not given up their claim to the English throne. In 1066 Harold had to march north into Yorkshire to defeat the Danes. No sooner had he defeated them than he learnt that William had landed in England with his army. Harold’s men were tired, but they had no time to rest. They marched south as fast as possible.</p>
      <p>Harold decided not to wait for the whole Saxon army, the fyrd, to gather because William’s army was small. He thought he could beat them with the men who had done so well against the Danes. However, the Norman soldiers were better armed, better organised, and were mounted on horses. If he had waited, Harold might have won. But he was defeated and killed in the battle near Hastings. William marched to London, which quickly gave in when he began to burn villages outside the city. He was crowned king of England in Edward’s new church of Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066. A new period began.</p>
