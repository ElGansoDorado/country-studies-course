      <h2 class="uppercase">The UK State and Political System</h2>

      <p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is one of the few developed countries of the world where a constitutional monarchy has survived with its customs, traditions and ceremonies. It is common knowledge that Great Britain, having the oldest Parliament in the world, has one of the most stable and effective political regimes of our time. Under the British Constitution the Government functions through the following bodies: the Legislature which makes laws; the Executive which puts laws into effect and plans policy; and the Judiciary which decides on cases that arise out of&nbsp;laws.</p>

      <p>The Palace of Westminster has been a centre of power for over 900 years. Parliament is known as “Westminster”, since it is housed in the Palace of Westminster, once a home of the&nbsp;monarchy.</p>
      <p>Like the monarchy, Parliament is an ancient institution, dating from the middle of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. It developed naturally out of the daily political needs of the English King and his&nbsp;government.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t1" style="clear: both;">The Origins and Development of the British Parliament</h3>
      <p>The modern UK Parliament can trace its origins all the way back to two features of the Anglo-Saxon government from the 8<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> centuries. They are the Witan and the&nbsp;moot.</p>
      <p>The Witan was the occasion when the king would call together his leading advisors and nobles to discuss matters affecting the country. The Witan’s main duty was to advise the king, but its assent was not necessary for the king to take action. Nor did it help frame the laws, as the modern Parliament does, but primarily consented to the laws the king had already decided to enact. However, Anglo-Saxon kings realized that they could not govern their territories without local support from these powerful men, and so began the delicate balancing act between the king’s power and the power of those he&nbsp;governed.</p>
      <p>After the Norman Conquest kings of England began to govern through a smaller but permanent inner council of advisers and officials, but occasionally the king would call on additional nobles (earls and barons) and churchmen (bishops and abbots) to gain their approval of his decisions, especially regarding taxation. This larger group of noble advisors especially summoned was known as the Great Council which evolved into the Parliament of&nbsp;England.</p>
      <p>Under the Anglo-Saxons there were regular meetings, or moots, for each county (or shire) where cases were heard and local matters discussed. The shire moot was attended by the local lords and bishops, the sheriff, and most importantly, four representatives of each village. After the Conquest, that meeting became known as the County Court and it introduced the idea of representative government at the local&nbsp;level.</p>
      <p>These two gatherings remained separate for many centuries, but eventually the noble councilors of the Great Council and the local spokesmen of the County Court would combine to make a Parliament of two Houses, the aristocratic Lords and the locally representative&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <p>The first known official use of the term Parliament was in&nbsp;1236. It described the consultative meetings of the English monarch with a large group of his nobles (the earls and barons), and prelates (the bishops and abbots). The word “<i>parliament</i>” means an event arranged to talk and discuss things, from the French word&nbsp;“<i>parler</i>”.</p>
      <p>For the first few centuries of its existence Parliament was only an occasion and not an institution. It was called at the whim of the monarch, consisted of whoever he wanted to speak with, met wherever he happened to be, could last as long as he wanted, and had no independent officials of its own. During the 13<sup>th</sup> century the barons were frequently in revolt against the kings whom they thought were governing the realm badly, that is, against the barons’ own wishes. In&nbsp;1215 King John was forced to agree to Magna Carta, the “great charter” of legal rights which insisted that he listen to and follow the advice of the barons. Then, at the meeting of Parliament at Oxford in&nbsp;1258 the barons stated their dissatisfaction with Henry III, and tried to force him to accept a set of conditions called <i>the Provisions of Oxford.</i> Those radical proposals called for regular meetings of Parliament three times a year, which should also include 12 non-noble representatives chosen from the counties. Henry III refused to agree to the provisions and war broke out between him and the leader of the barons, Simon de Montfort. Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by Montfort’s army. In&nbsp;1264, Montfort summoned the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation. His Parliament is seen as the earliest forerunner of the modern Parliament because it included not only the men who made up the Great Council, but also two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each&nbsp;borough.</p>
      <p>Montfort’s scheme was formally adopted by Edward I in the so-called “Model Parliament” of 1295. The attendance at parliament of knights and burgesses historically became known as the summoning of “the Commons”. In&nbsp;1341, the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was an Upper Chamber and a Lower&nbsp;Chamber.</p>
      <p>The authority of parliament grew under <a href="7.1.html#edward-3">Edward III</a> who was involved in the Hundred Years’ War and needed finances. The Commons came to act with increasing boldness during this period. It was established that no law could be made, nor any tax levied, without the consent of both Houses and the Sovereign. During the Good Parliament (1376), the Presiding Officer of the lower chamber, <a href="7.1.html#de-la-mare">Sir Peter de la Mare</a>, complained of heavy taxes, demanded an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticised the king’s management of the military. De la Mare was thus the forerunner of the office of Speaker of the House of Commons&nbsp;– a member elected by the Commons to chair its business and represent its views. The Commons even proceeded to impeach some of the king’s&nbsp;ministers.</p>
      <p>During the reign of the next monarch, Richard II, the Commons once again began to impeach errant ministers of the Crown. They insisted that they could not only control taxation, but also public expenditure. Despite such gains in authority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the House of Lords and the&nbsp;Crown.</p>
      <p>In the 15<sup>th</sup> century the Commons acquired an equal role in making laws. From its beginning one of Parliament’s roles had been as a forum for the hearing of private petitions&nbsp;– requests for help or favour from the people&nbsp;– submitted to the King and Lords. Increasingly, the Commons became the principal petitioners to this Upper House, submitting common petitions which addressed general problems which could be solved by the King through new laws, known as statutes. Then petitioners began to submit their grievances first to the Commons and, based on these petitions, the Commons wrote draft statutes, known as Bills, to be presented to the Upper House. In&nbsp;1414 the Commons successfully insisted to <a href="7.1.html#henry-5">Henry V</a> that the King and Lords should not change the wording of any of the Bills submitted by the Commons without its agreement and that no Bill should become an Act (that is, become statute), without their assent. By the mid-15<sup>th </sup>century the Commons had been in control of granting supply of money to the King and had gone from petitioners to full partners in the formation of statute, the highest law of the&nbsp;land.</p>
      <p>By the time Henry VII came to the throne in&nbsp;1485 the monarch had not been a member of either the Upper Chamber or the Lower Chamber. Consequently, the monarch would have to make his or her feelings known to Parliament through his or her supporters in both houses. Proceedings were regulated by the presiding officer in either chamber. From the 1540s the presiding officer in the House of Commons became formally known as the “Speaker”. This was not an enviable job. When the House of Commons was unhappy it was the Speaker who had to deliver this news to the monarch. That began the tradition whereby the Speaker of the House of Commons is dragged to the Speaker’s Chair by other members once&nbsp;elected.</p>
      <p>Henry VIII’s Reformation Parliament, which sat from 1529 to 1536, fundamentally changed the nature of Parliament and of English government. The King summoned it in order to settle what was called his ‘great matter’, his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, which the Papacy in Rome was blocking. In only a few short years, Parliament&nbsp;– under the direction and impetus of the King&nbsp;– made laws affecting all aspects of national life, especially in religious practice and doctrine, which had previously been under the authority of the Church alone. It passed laws which transferred religious authority from the Pope to the English Crown, gave the Crown control over the wealth and buildings of the old Church, settled official religious doctrine, altered the succession by declaring several of the King’s children illegitimate, and inaugurated a wider programme of social, religious and economic reform. Parliament still existed only by the monarch’s will, but Henry VIII and his immediate successors knew that they could best effect their will through the assent of Parliament in&nbsp;statute.</p>
      <p>Parliament did not always submit to the wishes of the Tudor monarchs. But parliamentary criticism of the monarchy reached new levels in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. In&nbsp;1628, alarmed by the arbitrary exercise of royal power, the House of Commons submitted to Charles I <i>the Petition of Right</i>, demanding the restoration of their liberties. Charles accepted the petition, but later dissolved parliament and ruled without it for eleven years. In&nbsp;1640 he was forced to recall Parliament historically known as the Short Parliament to authorise new taxes. The parliament which sat with several breaks and in various forms between 1640 and 1660 is known as the Long Parliament. It was characterised by the growing number of critics of the king who sat in it. Tensions between the king and his parliament reached a boiling point in January 1642 when Charles entered the House of Commons and tried, unsuccessfully, to arrest some of its members for their alleged treason. From then on relations between the king and his parliament deteriorated further, leading to the Civil War, the execution of the king and the start of an 11-year republic. The House of Lords was abolished and the House of Commons governed England until April 1653, when Oliver Cromwell dissolved it after disagreements over religious policy and how to carry out elections to&nbsp;Parliament.</p>
      <p>The events that took place in&nbsp;1649–1660 were hugely important in determining the future of Parliament. In terms of the evolution of Parliament as an institution, by far the most important development during the Republic was the sitting of Parliament without the monarch and the House of Lords. Members of the House of Commons became known as “MPs” (Members of Parliament). In&nbsp;1657 Cromwell had the Parliament of Scotland unified with the English&nbsp;Parliament.</p>
      <p>After the death of Oliver Cromwell the Convention Parliament which was dominated by royalists was summoned. This parliament voted to re-instate the monarchy and the House of Lords. Charles II returned to England as king in May 1660. The Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union that Cromwell had established was dissolved in&nbsp;1661 when the Scottish Parliament resumed its separate meeting place in Edinburgh. In&nbsp;1681 Charles II dissolved parliament and ruled without it for the last four years of his&nbsp;reign.</p>
      <p>During the reign of William III and Mary II Parliament was able to have the 1689 Bill of Rights enacted. Later the 1701 Act of Settlement was approved. Those were the statutes that lawfully upheld the prominence of Parliament for the first time in English history. These events marked the beginning of the English constitutional monarchy and its role as one of the three elements of&nbsp;Parliament.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/7-2.jpg" alt="The Act of Union of 1707">
        <figcaption>The Act of Union of 1707</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Following the Treaty of Union in&nbsp;1706, Acts of Union were passed in both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, which created a new Kingdom of Great Britain. The Acts dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new parliament, referred to as the “Parliament of Great&nbsp;Britain”.</p>
      <p>After the Hanoverian King George I ascended the British throne in&nbsp;1714 real power continued to shift away from the monarchy. George entrusted power to a group of his ministers, the foremost of them was Sir Robert Walpole, and by the end of his reign in&nbsp;1727 the position of the ministers, who had to rely on Parliament for support, was cemented. George I’s successor, his son George II, continued to follow his father’s domestic policies and made little effort to re-establish monarchical control over the government which was now in firm control by Parliament. George II’s successor, George III, sought to restore the royal supremacy and an absolute monarchy, but by the end of his reign the position of the king’s ministers, who discovered that they needed the support of Parliament to enact any major changes, had become central to the role of British governance, and would remain so ever&nbsp;after.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;1801, the Parliament of the United Kingdom was created when the Kingdom of Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the 1800 Acts of&nbsp;Union.</p>
      <p>Until the 19<sup>th</sup> century the House of Lords was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice. The supremacy of the British House of Commons was reaffirmed in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Since the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of the House of Lords have been very much less than those of the House of Commons. All bills except money bills are debated and voted upon in the House of Lords; however, by voting against a bill, the House of Lords can only delay it for a maximum of two parliamentary sessions over a year. After that time, the House of Commons can force the Bill through without the Lords’ consent, under the Parliament&nbsp;Acts.</p>
      <p>The Irish Free State became independent in&nbsp;1922, and in&nbsp;1927 parliament was renamed the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t2">The British Constitution</h3>
      <p>Britain is a constitutional monarchy. That means that the country is governed by a king or queen who accepts the advice of a parliament. It is also a parliamentary democracy. That is, it is a country whose government is controlled by a parliament which has been elected by the&nbsp;people.</p>
      <p>There are features of the British system of government which make it different from that in other countries and which are not ‘modern’ at all. The most notable of them is the question of the constitution. Britain is almost alone among modern states in that it does not have ‘a constitution’ at all. Of course, there are rules, regulations, principles and procedures for the running of the country, but there is no single written document which can be appealed to as the highest law of the land and the final arbiter in any matter of dispute. Nobody can refer to ‘article 6’ or ‘the first amendment’ or anything like that, because nothing like that&nbsp;exists.</p>
      <p>Instead, the principles and procedures by which the country is governed and from which people’s rights are derived come from a number of different sources. They have been built up, bit by bit, over the centuries. Some of them are written down in laws agreed by Parliament, some of them have been spoken and then written down (judgements made in court) and some of them have never been written down at all. For example, there is no written law in Britain that says anything about who can be the Prime Minister or what the powers of the Prime Minister are, even though he or she is probably the most powerful person in the&nbsp;country.</p>
      <p>The British constitution was formed partly by statutes such as the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Act of Settlement of 1701, partly by laws and customs of Parliament and partly by conventions. It can be altered by Act of Parliament, or by general agreement to create, vary or abolish a convention. Amendments to Britain’s unwritten constitution are made by a simple majority support in both Houses of Parliament to be followed by the Royal&nbsp;Assent.</p>
      <p>There are two basic principles of the British Constitution: the Rule of Law and the Supremacy of Parliament. According to the latter Parliament can pass, repeal and alter any of Britain’s laws. This is one of the major powers that a government&nbsp;has.</p>
      <p>The Bill of Rights (1689) was a major legal step towards constitutional monarchy. It limited the powers of monarchy to a great extent, especially on governmental and other matters. Since 1689 the power of parliament has grown steadily, while the power of the monarch has weakened. Today the monarch reigns, though he does not rule. Being a constitutional monarch the King acts on the advice of his prime minister and does not make any major political&nbsp;decisions.</p>
      <p>Under the British Constitution the Government functions through the following&nbsp;bodies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Legislature which makes&nbsp;laws;</li>
        <li>the Executive which puts laws into effect and plans&nbsp;policy;</li>
        <li>the Judiciary which decides on cases that arise out of the&nbsp;laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t3">The British Monarch</h3>
      <p>In Britain the King is not only the head of state, but is the “symbol of their nation’s unity”. The King personifies the state; he is head of the executive, an integral part of legislature, head of the judiciary, the commander-in-chief of all armed forces, the supreme governor of the established Church of England, the Anglican Church, and the personal head of the&nbsp;Commonwealth.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/7-3.jpg" alt="King Charles III">
        <figcaption>King Charles III</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The United Kingdom is governed by His Majesty’s Government in the name of the King. Although the King is deprived of actual power, he has retained many important, though formal, functions. They include summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by both Houses of Parliament; appointing every important office holder, including government ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats and bishops and some other senior clergy of the Church of England; conferring peerages, knighthoods and other honours. He appoints the Prime Minister to form a government. As head of State the King has, in international affairs, the power to declare war and make peace, to recognize foreign states and governments, to conclude treaties, etc. He gives audiences to his ministers and other officials at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable state papers; he is informed and consulted on every aspect of national&nbsp;life.</p>
      <p>The royal family serves as a custodian of British standards and values. Today the monarchy is also one of the great tourist attractions: Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London and Windsor Castle are on the list of priorities for most of tourists visiting Britain. Despite all the tragedies and scandals involving members of the Royal Family, the general public still supports the idea of preserving its traditions. The general feeling about monarchy is probably best described by a well-known British politician Christopher Owen who said, “We need the monarchy, as surely as ship needs an anchor. It is the Crown which provides unity and stability to Britain and the&nbsp;Commonwealth.”</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t4">The Houses of Parliament</h3>
      <p>The Parliament of Great Britain is the legislative body of the nation. There are three elements of the British Parliament&nbsp;– the King and the two Houses of Parliament (the House of Lords and House of Commons). These elements are outwardly separate, constituted on different principles, and they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance, such as coronation, or the State Opening of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by the King to the House of Lords. In modern practice the centre of parliamentary power is in the House of&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <p>The main functions of Parliament are&nbsp;to:</p>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>make all the UK&nbsp;law;</li>
        <li>provide, by voting for taxation, the means of carrying on the work of&nbsp;government;</li>
        <li>protect the public and safeguard the rights of&nbsp;individuals;</li>
        <li>scrutinise government policy and administration, including proposals for&nbsp;expenditure;</li>
        <li>examine European proposals before they become&nbsp;law;</li>
        <li>debate the major issues of the&nbsp;day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Parliament Act of 1911 fixed the life of Parliament (the House of Commons) at five years, although it may be dissolved and a general election held before the end of the term. The life of Parliament is divided into sessions. Each session usually lasts for a year and begins most often in October or November. The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons in a normal session is about 175, divided into the following periods: from November till Christmas (about 40 sitting days), from January to Easter (about 50 sitting days), and from about the beginning of June until about late July or early August (40 to 50 sitting days). The House of Lords sits for about 140 days. The periods when Parliament is not sitting are popularly known as&nbsp;recesses.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/7-4.jpg" alt="The House of Commons">
        <figcaption>The House of Commons</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The arrangement of seating in both Houses of Parliament reflects the party system. Both debating chambers are rectangular in shape and have at one end the seat of the Speaker, in front of the Table of the House (the House of Commons) and at the other end a technical barrier. The benches for members run the length of the chamber on both sides. Intersected by a gang-way, the benches face each other across a broad area known as the ‘floor of the House’. The benches to the right of the Speaker are used by the Government and its supporters; those to the left belong to the Opposition, and members of any other parties. In the House of Lords there are also bishops’ benches and a number of cross-benches for peers who do not belong to any&nbsp;party.</p>
      <p>Leaders of the Government and the Opposition sit on the front benches of their respective sides to the Speaker’s seat. The backbenchers, the ordinary members of Parliament, occupy the seats behind the front&nbsp;benchers.</p>
      <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons presides over the House of Commons. In debate all speeches are addressed to him, and he calls upon members to speak. If he rises to give a ruling upon a doubtful point, or for any other reason, he must be heard in silence, and while he is on his her feet no other MP may remain standing. The Speaker has two main functions: representing the House in its relations with the Crown, the House of Lords and other authorities; presiding over the House and enforcing the observance of all rules which govern its conduct. Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the Speaker, whose duty is to pronounce the final result. In the event of a tied vote the Speaker must give his decisive&nbsp;vote.</p>
      <img class="left" src="../img/7-5.jpg" alt="Voting in House of Commons">
      <p>A vote is taken by means of a division, that is to say the separation into two lobbies of the members who wish to vote for or against a question. Members voting ‘Aye’ go out of the chamber into the lobby on the right of the Speaker, while those voting ‘No’ pass into the lobby on his&nbsp;left.</p>
      <p>The House of Commons consists of 650 MPs but it can seat some 350 MPs. So when he or she wins a “seat” in the House of Commons during the General Election this doesn’t necessarily mean a new MP will actually have a seat there. On ordinary occasions MPs who also have much committee, party and constituency business to attend to, are not expected to be in constant attendance in the debating chamber. When any special business is about to be taken&nbsp;– for instance, if a vote on some legislative or other matter is pending&nbsp;– steps are taken to secure their presence. At other times, there may be more or fewer members present, depending on the speakers and the subject for&nbsp;debate.</p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img src="../img/7-6.jpg" alt="The House of Lords">
        <figcaption>The House of Lords</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Houses of Parliament which members are not elected. Its composition is different from that of the House of Commons. There were traditionally a large number of Conservative peers in the Lords but this is no longer the case since the majority of hereditary peers were excluded from membership of the House following the 1999 House of Lords Act. About two thirds of the Lords align themselves with a political party. A distinctive feature of the House of Lords is the presence of crossbench peers who are not affiliated to any party group. Some Lords are former Members of the House of Commons who have been elevated to the Lords in recognition of distinguished service in politics or because one of the political parties wishes to have them in the House. The overall numbers and membership of the House of Lords changes more frequently than they do in the House of&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <p>In general, the functions of the House of Lords are similar to those of the House of Commons in legislating, debating and questioning the executive. There are two important exceptions: members of the Lords do not represent constituencies, and are not involved in matters of taxation and finance. The role of the Lords is generally recognised to be complementary to that of the Commons and it acts as a revising chamber for many of the more important and controversial bills. All bills go through both Houses before becoming Acts, and may start in either House. Normally, the consent of the Lords is required before Acts of Parliament can be passed, and the Lords can amend all legislation, with the exception of bills to raise taxation, long seen as the responsibility of the Commons. Amendments have to be agreed to by both&nbsp;Houses.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/7-7.jpg" alt="The Lord Chancellor’s Woolsack">
        <figcaption>The Lord Chancellor’s Woolsack</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Speaker of the House of Lords is the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor’s powers are very limited compared with those of the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor carries no authority to control debate. Members of the House of Lords do not address themselves to the Lord Chancellor during debates, but to their fellow members in the House. If, during a debate, two peers rise to their feet at the same time, the House itself determines who shall speak: the Lord Chancellor has no power to decide which peer shall take the floor. The Lord Chancellor sits on a special seat called the Woolsack. It was introduced by King Edward III (1327–1377) and originally stuffed with English wool as a reminder of England’s traditional source of wealth&nbsp;– the wool trade&nbsp;– and as a sign of prosperity. Today the woolsack is stuffed with wool from several countries of the Commonwealth to symbolize&nbsp;unity.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t5" style="clear: both;">The Election System</h3>
      <p>Every four or five years (it cannot be more than five and is rarely less than four) there is a General Election to decide who should become Members of Parliament. Voting is carried out on the basis of territorial areas with roughly similar populations called constituencies. There are about 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom with 60,000–70,000 electors in each of&nbsp;them.</p>
      <p>When the Prime Minister announces that there will be a General Election, a three-week election campaign includes open meetings, television programmes, candidates and their supporters visiting households and discussing issues, leaflets, politicians ‘meeting the people’ and listening to their complaints. In each constituency the candidates will publish their manifesto describing the different polices of their party towards such matters as tax, health and education, how to treat criminals, attitudes to world affairs. They speak about their particular interests and ask to be elected as servants of the people. On Election Day, each person in the country who wants to vote goes to the polling station, collects a voting paper which has a list of candidates and marks an ‘X’ beside the one candidate they wish to be elected. There is no ‘Against All Candidates’ option. In each constituency, the candidate with most votes wins in a simple ‘first-past-the-post’ (abbreviated FPTP or FPP) system. The term is taken from horse racing, where the winner of the race is the first to pass a particular point on the track after which all other runners automatically and completely lose (that is, “winner-take-all”). He or she does not have to have 51&nbsp;% of the vote&nbsp;– simply more votes than anyone else. The person who wins the highest number of votes wins that election, for example: candidate A (Labour) has 22,000 votes, candidate B (Tory)&nbsp;– 17,000 votes and candidate C (Lib Dems)&nbsp;– 13,000 votes. The winner is candidate&nbsp;A.</p>
      <p>FPTP is a cheap and simple way to hold an election. Counting of the ballot papers is usually fast. FPTP has created within Great Britain a political system that is essentially stable as politics is dominated by just two&nbsp;parties.</p>
      <p>Critics say that FPTP questions the whole issue of democratic elections. In the example above, 22,000 voted for the candidate that won that election but 30,000 voted against the&nbsp;winner.</p>
      <p>Let us examine what happens at this imaginary election when the Conservative Party wins because the results of the election produce a Parliament consisting of 300 Conservative MPs, 200 Labour MPs, 110 Liberal Democrat members and 40 MPs from Northern Ireland and the small nationalist parties. The Conservative Party has the largest number of members in Parliament, so it has to form the Government. The person who is already the leader of the Conservative Party automatically becomes Prime Minister. There is no separate election for&nbsp;him.</p>
      <p>If a general election creates a situation when no party has an overall majority then a formal coalition is formed to get laws passed as it was at the 2010 general election. As a result of negotiations the Conservatives formed such a coalition with the Liberal-Democratic&nbsp;Party.</p>
      <p>On 5 May 2011 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government held a referendum on introducing the <i>Alternative Vote</i> for the Commons, which was&nbsp;defeated.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t6">Passing Laws</h3>
      <p>Laws are rules that everyone in the country must obey. In a democracy, like the UK, nobody is above the law. For a law to be enacted a bill must be presented and go through all the necessary stages in both Houses of Parliament and the King must signify his&nbsp;approval.</p>
      <p>The Commons is normally the most important procedural step in this process. A bill will receive a formal first reading when it is introduced into the Commons by the government or a private member. After a period ranging from one day to several months, the bill is given its second reading after a debate on its general principles. The bill is then usually passed to a standing committee for detailed discussion and amendment. This committee stage is followed by the report stage, during which further amendments to the bill may be suggested. The third reading of the bill considers it in its final form, usually on a purely formal basis. However, debate is still possible at this stage if demanded by at least six&nbsp;MPs.</p>
      <p>After the third reading, a Commons bill will be sent to the House of Lords. It will then go through broadly the same stages again. The Lords can delay a non-financial bill for two sessions, or roughly one year. It can also propose amendments, and if amended the bill goes back to the Commons for further consideration. This amending function is an important power, and has been frequently used in recent years. But the Lords’ role today is to act as a forum for revision, rather than as a rival to the elected&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <img class="center" src="../img/7-8.jpg" alt="How does a Bill become a Law">
      <p>When the bill has eventually passed through the Lords, it is sent to the monarch for the Royal Assent, which has not been refused since the eighteenth century. After the royal signature has been added, the bill becomes an Act of&nbsp;Parliament.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t7">Parliamentary Procedure</h3>
      <p>Parliamentary procedure in both Houses of Parliament is mainly based on custom, convention and&nbsp;precedent.</p>
      <p>Each parliamentary session begins with the State Opening of Parliament. It takes place when Parliament reassembles after a general election, normally in November. It is the main ceremonial event of the parliamentary year, attracting large crowds, both in person and watching on&nbsp;television.</p>
      <p>The Monach’s Speech is delivered from the Throne in the House of Lords. The speech is given in the presence of members of both Houses, the Commons being summoned to hear the speech by an official known as Black&nbsp;Rod.</p>
      <p>Although the speech is made by the King, the content of the speech is entirely designed by the Government and approved by the Cabinet. It is an outline of the Government’s policies and proposed legislative programme for the current parliamentary&nbsp;session.</p>
      <p>After the State Opening, the Government’s programme is debated. The motion is that the House sends an address to the King thanking him for the speech, but the debate, which lasts several days, is in fact a chance for MPs to speak on any matter of government&nbsp;policy.</p>
      <p>For most of the year the Commons adopts a routine of meeting each weekday afternoon, and ‘sitting’ until about 10.30 p. m. although it sometimes sits beyond midnight. On Fridays the Commons sits from 9.30 a. m. through to 3.00 p. m., rising early in order to allow MPs to return to their constituencies for the weekend, where they must make themselves available and accessible for local matters, complaints and attendance at formal functions. The proceedings of Parliament are public, and space is available for a small number of people, especially the press, to listen. Proceedings of both Houses are also now televised, the Lords since 1984 and the Commons since 1989. The manner in which business is conducted is the result of custom and precedent, from which have emerged ‘standing order’ which govern the details of practice in each&nbsp;House.</p>
      <p>Each day begins, after brief opening formalities, with Question Time, lasting approximately an hour, MPs are able to ask ministers or other MPs questions on any point they may choose. Questions must be handed in&nbsp;48 hours ahead, to allow ministers and their departmental staff time to prepare an answer. Naturally, both the Opposition and the party of government seek to use this period in order to reveal the weakness of their opponents. Once a minister’s formal answer has been given, supplementary questions may be asked which the minister is expected to answer. On two afternoons each week the Prime Minister will answer questions on general policy matters. These occasions are usually the liveliest. After Question Time, the main debate of the day takes place. Most of the time available in any parliamentary session is devoted to scrutiny of government spending, and debating new bills the government wishes to&nbsp;introduce.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t8">Parliamentary Ceremonies</h3>
      <p>The State Opening is a royal ceremony of great antiquity which marks the start of a parliamentary year. It is customary for the Sovereign to be present at the ceremony, which serves as a symbolic reminder of the unity of the three constituent parts of Parliament: the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <p>The broad outlines of the ceremony have remained largely unchanged for centuries: a procession by the Sovereign to the Palace of Westminster is followed by the assembling of the Members of both Houses, and the reading of the Speech, which sets out the Government’s agenda and key legislative&nbsp;plans.</p>
      <figure class="right">

        <figcaption>The 1851 Irish State Coach</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The modern state opening ceremony dates to 1852, when the new Palace of Westminster was opened. The route within Parliament that Charles III follows today was used by Queen Victoria for the first time in&nbsp;1852. And the Irish State Coach which the present Sovereign rides in today was bought by Queen Victoria and used for the first time in&nbsp;1852.</p>
      <p>In a solemn procession he proceeds to the House of Lords where the lords have gathered. After the King has taken his seat on the Throne, he despatches Black Rod to the Commons Chamber to summon MPs to hear the Speech. The door of the Commons is slammed in Black Rod’s face. Black Rod then bangs three times on the door with the rod. The tradition has been continued as a way to symbolise the Commons’ independence from the Sovereign and the Lords. After knocking, Black Rod is admitted to the Commons chamber and requests Members’ attendance. MPs pair up, led by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and follow Black Rod to the bar of the House of Lords to hear the King’s Speech (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UupHsxptd2M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">State Opening of Parliament&nbsp;/ 10 May 2022&nbsp;/ House of&nbsp;Lords</a>).</p>
      <p>Both the Commons’ and the Lords’ Speaker formally open their respective Houses each day with a ceremonial procession from their official residences within the Palace to their respective Chambers at the start of business. These processions can be observed by the&nbsp;public.</p>
      <p>The origins of the Speaker’s procession are unclear. Two theories predominate. It has been suggested that early Speakers were routinely accompanied by a bodyguard as they went about, in recognition of the dangers of the job. The presence of the Serjeant-at-Arms with the mace in the procession supports this. However, alternatively, and in light of the fact that the Commons’ proceedings begin with prayers led by the Chaplain, it is thought the original procession may have been associated with some more elaborate form of&nbsp;worship.</p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="../img/7-10.jpg" alt="The House of Commons Mace">
        <figcaption>The House of Commons Mace</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Either way, the procession today consists of a Commons’ Doorkeeper, the Sergeant-at-Arms with the mace, the Speaker, the Trainbearer, Chaplain and Secretary. The procession moves circuitously from Speaker’s House through the Library Corridor, the Lower Waiting Hall, Central and Members’ Lobbies to the Chamber. This route was adopted during the Second World War when the Commons used the House of Lords chamber after their own had been destroyed. This route has been retained in preference to the shorter pre-war route so that visitors in Central Lobby can witness the ceremony. The procession walks at a slow, formal&nbsp;pace.</p>
      <p>The police along the route call out ‘Speaker’, to signify that any people present should stand aside for the Speaker’s procession. In Central Lobby, where there may be members of the public, the police inspector on duty shouts “Hats off, Strangers”. Nowadays, few may be wearing hats but the police remove their helmets, and this aspect of the ceremony is a relic of the elaborate hat wearing and doffing etiquette of former centuries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6s8otOeIoU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">New U.K. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle Takes Part in First&nbsp;Procession</a>).</p>
      <p>As in the Commons, before each day’s sitting the Lord Speaker walks in procession from the official residence in the Palace to the Lords’ chamber. The procession consists of a Doorkeeper, the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms or Principal Doorkeeper bearing the Mace, and the Lord Speaker. The procession crosses the Prince’s Chamber (a small anteroom between the Royal Gallery and the Lords Chamber) where Black Rod joins the end of the procession. They then process through the ‘Not Content’ (i. e. the ‘no’) Lobby, and enter the Chamber on the ‘temporal side’, that is, the left side as viewed from the throne, which is contrasted to the ‘spiritual side’ on the right, traditionally occupied by Government Members and the Bishops. The Lord Speaker continues up the temporal side to the woolsack. Next, prayers are read by one of the Bishops, who take a week each in turn. During prayers, the Lord Speaker and other Members present kneel or stand for prayers. The Lord Speaker then takes her seat on the woolsack and the day’s business&nbsp;commences.</p>
      <p>The present form of the Lord Speaker’s Procession evolved from that of the Lord Chancellor, and results from recommendations made by the Procedure Committee in May 2006, following the changes made in the Speakership of the House of Lords by the Constitutional Reform Act of&nbsp;2005.</p>
      <p>Another ceremony known as dragging the Speaker of the House of Commons is connected with the election of a new Speaker. The successful candidate is physically dragged to the Chair by other MPs. This custom has its roots in the Speaker’s function to communicate the Commons’ opinions to the monarch. Historically, if the monarch didn’t agree with the message being communicated then the early death of the Speaker could&nbsp;follow.</p>
      <p>To participate in a debate in the House of Commons or at question time, MPs have to be called by the Speaker. MPs usually rise or half-rise from their seats in a bid to get the Speaker’s attention&nbsp;– this is known as ‘catching the Speaker’s&nbsp;eye’.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t9">The British Government</h3>
      <p>The party which wins most parliamentary seats at a general election, or which has the support of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons, usually forms the new government. The largest minority party becomes the official opposition. The opposition has its own leader and ‘shadow government’. It plays an important constitutional role in the parliamentary system, which is based on adversarial and confrontational&nbsp;politics.</p>
      <p>His Majesty’s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is led by the Prime Minister appointed by the King. The Prime Minister then selects the other ministers which make up the Government and act as political heads of the various government&nbsp;departments.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister’s functions&nbsp;involve:</p>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>leading the majority&nbsp;party;</li>
        <li>running the&nbsp;Government;</li>
        <li>appointing and dismissing&nbsp;ministers;</li>
        <li>representing the nation in political&nbsp;matters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>About 30 most senior government ministers make up the Cabinet and approximately 100 ministers in total comprise the government. The key posts in the Cabinet are a Home Secretary, a Foreign Secretary and a Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister). There are also Ministers for Health, Education, Employment, Transport, etc. All ministers within the government are Members of Parliament. The composition of governments can vary both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. New ministerial offices may be created, others may be abolished, and functions may be transferred from one minister to&nbsp;another.</p>

        <figcaption>The Cabinet Office</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Prime Minister presides over the Cabinet which is the most important decision maker in the Government. It initiates policy on domestic problems, and also has to decide what actions to take in foreign affairs. It plans the economic and financial policy for the country: what should be done about taxes, prices, wages, benefits and so on. Once the Cabinet has decided on a policy, all members must agree to support it. Government proposals are then out to the Members of Parliament for debate. The Prime Minister and the most important ministers from the Cabinet meet weekly and effectively rule the country. The monarch is obliged to follow the advice of the government and has not refused to do so since the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister informs the King at regular meetings of the general business of the Government. The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include recommending a number of appointments to the&nbsp;King.</p>

      <h3 class="left indent" id="t10" style="clear: both;">The Political Party System</h3>
      <p>Britain is normally described as having a ‘two-party system’. This is because, since 1945, one of the two big parties has controlled the government, and members of these two parties have occupied more than 90&nbsp;% of all the seats in the House of&nbsp;Commons.</p>
      <p>One reason for the existence of this situation is the electoral system. The other is the nature of the origin of British political parties. Britain is unlike most other countries in that its parties were first formed inside Parliament, and were only later extended to the public at large. During the eighteenth century Members of Parliament tended to divide themselves into two camps, those who usually supported the government of the time and those who usually did not. During the nineteenth century it gradually became the habit that the party which did not control the government presented itself as an alternative government. This idea of an alternative government has received legal recognition. The leader of the second biggest party in the House of Commons (or, more exactly, of the biggest party which is not in government) receives the title “Leader of His Majesty’s Opposition” and even gets a salary to prove the importance of this role and forms a “Shadow&nbsp;cabinet”.</p>
      <p>The electoral system depends to a large extent upon the party political system. Organized political parties present their policies in the form of manifestos to the electorate for consideration during the intensive few weeks of canvassing and campaigning before the General Election&nbsp;Day.</p>
      <p>The current party system is represented by a number of&nbsp;parties.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, known informally as the Tories, is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom. The governing party since 2010, it is the largest in the House of Commons. The Conservative Prime Ministers, particularly Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, led governments for 57 years of the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Party was one of the two major parties in the United Kingdom with the opposing Conservative Party in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. The party arose in the 1850s. At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the Liberal Party passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state. The party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general&nbsp;elections.</p>
      <p>In the early 1920 the Labour Party overtook the Liberal Party to become the main opposition to the Conservative Party. The Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom that has been described as an alliance of social democrats, democratic socialists and trade unionists. The party’s platform emphasises greater state intervention, social justice and strengthening workers’ rights. The Labour Party was founded in&nbsp;1900, having grown out of the trade union movement and socialist parties of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Labour is currently the Official Opposition in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having won the second-largest number of seats in the 2017 general&nbsp;election.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats or the Lib Dems were founded in&nbsp;1988 by an amalgamation of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. The Liberal Democrats are quite often referred to as a ‘centre’ party&nbsp;– a party which in ideological terms plays upon the differences between the two major parties, tending to be closer to the Labour party. The Liberal Democrats combine an ideological tradition of liberalism with social democracy. The Liberal Democrats support institutional reform in the United Kingdom, including the decentralisation of state power, reform of Parliament, and electoral reform. The Liberal Democrats were the only one of Britain's three major parties to oppose the invasion of&nbsp;Iraq.</p>
      <p>The nationalist parties of the UK have been a significant political force since the 1970s, and today they are more significant than ever. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, has had continuous representation in Parliament since 1974. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn F&eacute;in, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) are considered the four major political parties in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) advocates the separation of Scotland from the United Kingdom in order to safeguard the country’s cultural and economic&nbsp;life.</p>
